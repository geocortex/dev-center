Extending Geocortex Workflow Server requires administrative access to your on premise installation of workflow.
:::

Geocortex Workflow Server can be extending by augmenting your on premise installation with additional custom .NET assemblies. The various workflow server use cases, such as [Implement a Custom Activity](implement-custom-activity-server.mdx), describe how to deploy your custom code to your on premise installation.
