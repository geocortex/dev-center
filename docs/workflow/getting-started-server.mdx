Geocortex Workflow Server can be extended by augmenting your on premise installation with additional custom .NET assemblies.

## Requirements

Extending Geocortex Workflow Server requires administrative access to your on premise installation of workflow.

## Development Environment

Visual Studio 2019 is the only officially supported development environment for extending Geocortex Workflow Server.

## Setting up a Geocortex Workflow Server Extension Project

Extending Geocortex Workflow Server requires you to produce a separate assembly with your custom activities, and copy that into your on premise deployment of Geocortex Workflow. We first need to set up a project using Visual Studio that references the [workflow runtime](concepts-key-concepts.mdx#geocortex-workflow-designer-and-runtime).

1. Launch Microsoft Visual Studio 2019.
1. Create a new project of type _Class Library_ (.NET Standard)
    - You can also create a project of type [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/what-is-dotnet) to take advantage of it's larger featureset. If so, you need to go into the project settings and change the output type to `Class Library`
1. Edit the `.csproj` file in a text editor and add the `CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies` attribute to the `PropertyGroup`.

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>
    <RootNamespace>CustomWorkflow</RootNamespace>
    <CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies>true</CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies>
</PropertyGroup>
```

-   This will copy the referenced nuget assemblies to the build output folder, which will be important for later.

1. Add a reference to the `Geocortex.Workflow.Runtime` assembly.  
   By default, this is located in`C:\Program Files\Latitude Geographics\Geocortex Workflow\Deployment\service`

:::important
.NET Standard projects **must** target .NET Standard 2.0, and .NET Core projects must target .NET Core 2.1, else the assembly will be incompatible with Geocortex Workflow Server
:::

Next, learn how to implement a [custom activity](implement-custom-activity-server.mdx) for Geocortex Workflow Server.

## Deploying Geocortex Workflow Server Activities

For Geocortex Workflow Server to find your custom activities, you need to copy the build output to a particular folder.

1. Build the project.
1. Find the build output on disk.
    1. In Visual Studio, right-click on your project in Solution Explorer and choose "Open Folder in File Explorer".
    1. Open the `bin` folder.  
       If you do not see a`bin` folder, it is possible you right-clicked on the solution instead of the project.
    1. In the `bin` folder, open either `Debug` or `Release`, depending on which build configuration you used.
    1. In the `bin\Debug` or `bin\Release` folder, there will be one final sub-directory which will be `netstandard2.0`
       or `netcore2.1`. Open this folder.
    1. You should now see a number of files including `Geocortex.Workflow.Runtime.dll` and your own project, such as `AssemblyNamespace.dll`.
1. Find the `CustomAssemblies` folder on disk.
    1. Geocortex Workflow looks in a folder called `CustomAssemblies` for assemblies that contain custom activities.
       This is located in the folder that you chose when installing Geocortex Workflow. The default location is  
       `C:\Program Files\Latitude Geographics\Geocortex Workflow\CustomAssemblies`
1. Copy the relevant files from the build output to the `CustomAssemblies` folder.
    1. Copy your project's assembly. (e.g. `AssemblyNamespace.dll`)
    1. Copy any third-party libraries that your project relies on (these should have been output to the build folder)
    1. Copy any other configuration files or resources that your project relies on.
    1. **Do not** copy any files that start with `Geocortex.Workflow.` They are not required in this folder.
    - If you created a .NET Core Project and see `AssemblyNamespace.exe`, you need to change the project output type to `Class Library`.

:::important
You may need to stop then restart Geocortex Workflow Server in order to copy your copy your custom code.
:::

## Debugging Server Workflow Activities

You can debug custom Geocortex Workflow Server activities by attaching to the Geocortex Workflow Server process from the Geocortex Workflow extension project you created.

1. Start Visual Studio 2019 with administrator privileges.
2. [Attach the debugger](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/debug-multiple-processes?view=vs-2019#BKMK_Attach_to_a_process) to the running `GeocortexWorkflowServer.exe` process.
    - You may need to check 'show processes from all users' to see it.
3. Set a breakpoint in your custom activity.
4. Run your server workflow that uses the custom activity. Your breakpoint should be hit.

## Automating Deployment of Server Workflow Activities

To automate the deployment to Geocortex Workflow Server, we have to add a post build step to the project that copies the build output.

1. Locate the `Custom Assemblies` folder in the Geocortex Workflow Server installation. The default location is `C:\Program Files\Latitude Geographics\Geocortex Workflow\CustomAssemblies`
2. Create a file `excluded_files.txt`at the root of the project that excludes the appropriate build output files as described in the [deployment section](#deploying-geocortex-workflow-server-activities).

```
Geocortex.Workflow.Runtime.dll
Geocortex.Workflow.Runtime.xml
```

2. Edit the post build event in the project properties.
    - Add a command which copies the build output to the `Custom Assemblies` folder.
    - `xcopy "$(OutDir)*" "C:\Program Files\Latitude Geographics\Geocortex Workflow\CustomAssemblies" /Exclude:$(ProjectDir)excludedFiles.txt /y`
3. Run a rebuild and ensure all appropriate files are copied.

You may need to stop then restart Geocortex Workflow Server in order for the post build step to copy your custom code.
