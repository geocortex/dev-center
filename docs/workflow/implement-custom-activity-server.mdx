Implementing a custom [activity](concepts-key-concepts.mdx#activities) allows you to build a reusable, completely custom behavior to augment the [existing activities](https://docs.geocortex.com/workflow/latest/help/Default.htm#wf5/help/activity-reference.htm%3FTocPath%3DActivities%7CActivity%2520Reference%7C_____0) that come with Geocortex Workflow.

## Scope

This article applies to building workflow activities that will be run on [Geocortex Workflow Server](https://docs.geocortex.com/workflow/latest/help/Default.htm#wf5/help/server-workflows.htm%3FTocPath%3DServer%2520Workflows%7C_____0).

## Prerequisites

<ServerPrereqs />

## Set up a new Custom Workflow Project

Follow the instructions to [set up a new Geocortex Workflow Server extension project](getting-started-server.mdx#setting-up-a-geocortex-workflow-server-extension-project).

## Set up the Activity Skeleton

1. Create a new file `CustomActivity` in the project.
2. Add a new skeleton workflow activity that implements `IActivityHandler`.

```csharp
using Geocortex.Workflow.Runtime;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace App1.Workflow.CustomActivity
{
    public class CustomActivity : IActivityHandler
    {
        public static string Action { get; } = "your:unique:namespace::CustomActivity";

        public Task<IDictionary<string, object>> Execute(IDictionary<string, object> inputs, IActivityContext context)
        {
            return Task.FromResult((IDictionary<string, object>)new Dictionary<string, object>());
        }
    }
}
```

:::tip
Use a unique prefix on the `Action` property to avoid it conflicting with someone elses custom activities.  
:::

## Register the Activity with an Assembly Attribute

1. Create a new file, `Properties\AssemblyInfo.cs`
1. Add the custom Geocortex Workflow attribute to `AssemblyInfo.cs`:

```csharp
[assembly: Geocortex.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowActivities]`
```

This registers the assembly to a namespace that Geocortex Workflow Server can discover.

:::note
By convention, assembly attributes are typically added to a file called `"Properties\AssemblyInfo.cs"`, but they can be added to any code file.
:::

## Deploy the Activity

Follow the instructions to [deploy Geocortex Workflow Server activities](getting-started-server.mdx#deploying-geocortex-workflow-server-activities).

## Implement the Custom Activity

We now have a empty activity that Geocortex Workflow Server can use that takes no inputs and produces no outputs. At this point, you can implement the appropriate business logic for your use case, using the features available with .NET Standard or .NET Core. This activity still does not have an easy to use interface in Geocortex Workflow Designer, but can be executed using [`RunActivity`](https://docs.geocortex.com/workflow/latest/help/Default.htm#wf5/help/activities/run-activity.htm%3FTocPath%3DActivities%7CActivity%2520Reference%7C_____167).

### Example: Logarithm of a Number

The following activity will calculate the log of a number with a given (optional) base.

<LogarithmActivitySnippet />

## Test your Activity

You can run your new activity with a [server workflow](https://docs.geocortex.com/workflow/latest/help/Default.htm#wf5/help/server-workflows.htm%3FTocPath%3DServer%2520Workflows%7C_____0). [`RunActivity`](https://docs.geocortex.com/workflow/latest/help/Default.htm#wf5/help/activities/run-activity.htm%3FTocPath%3DActivities%7CActivity%2520Reference%7C_____167) can be used to execute your activity by the name defined in `CustomActivity.cs` (for this example, `your:unique:namespace::CustomActivity`, or `your:unique:namespace::CalculateLog`). Check out [this article](getting-started-server.mdx#debugging-server-workflow-activities) to learn how to debug your custom activity code in Visual Studio.
