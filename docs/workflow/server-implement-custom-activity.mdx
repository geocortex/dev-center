title: Implement a Custom Activity for Geocortex Workflow Server
sidebar_label: Implement a Custom Activity
---

Implementing a custom [activity](concepts-workflow-activities-form-elements#activities) allows you to a build a reusable, completely custom behaviour to augment the [existing activities](https://docs.geocortex.com/workflow/latest/help/Default.htm#wf5/help/activity-reference.htm%3FTocPath%3DActivities%7CActivity%2520Reference%7C_____0) that come with Geocortex Workflow.

For workflows activities used in [Server Workflows](TODO - some sort of link here...) (which can be [run using the "RunWorkflow" activity on any platform](https://docs.geocortex.com/workflow/latest/help/Default.htm#wf5/help/server-workflows.htm#configure-client-workflow) activities are implemented using C# and the .NET Core platform).
