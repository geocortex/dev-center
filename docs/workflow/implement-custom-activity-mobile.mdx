Implementing a custom [activity](concepts-key-concepts.mdx#activities-and-form-elements) allows you to build a reusable, completely custom behaviour to augment the [existing activities](https://docs.geocortex.com/workflow/latest/help/Default.htm#wf5/help/activity-reference.htm%3FTocPath%3DActivities%7CActivity%2520Reference%7C_____0) that come with Geocortex Workflow.

## Scope

This article applies to building workflow activities that will be run on [Geocortex Mobile](https://www.geocortex.com/products/gxm/).

<MobilePrereqs />

## Setup the Activity Skeleton

1. Create a new file `CustomActivity` in the platform agnostic project of the Geocortex Mobile [quick start](../mobile/quick-start.mdx).
2. Add a new skeleton workflow activity that implements `IActivityHandler`.

```csharp
using Geocortex.Workflow.Runtime;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace App1.Workflow.CustomActivity
{
    public class CustomActivity : IActivityHandler
    {
        public const string Action = "custom:wf:app::CustomActivity";

        public Task<IDictionary<string, object>> Execute(IDictionary<string, object> inputs, IActivityContext context)
        {
            return Task.FromResult((IDictionary<string, object>)new Dictionary<string, object>());
        }
    }
}
```

:::tip
Use a unique prefix on the `Action` property to avoid it conflicting with someone else's custom activities.  
:::

## Register the Activity with the `IActivityHandlerFactory`

Every Geocortex Mobile application that implements custom workflow activities needs to implement an `IActivityHandlerFactory`. The `IActivityHandlerFactory` is responsible for registering the custom activities with Geocortex Mobile so they can be created by Geocortex Workflow at runtime.

-   If you've already created a `IActivityHandlerFactory`, register your new custom activity in the constructor.
-   Otherwise, create a new implementation of the `IActivityHandlerFactory` in a new file, `ActivityLoader.cs`

The `ActivityLoader` registers the activity skeleton we created by name in it's constructor. Only one instance of the loader is required per Geocortex Mobile Application, as it can register multiple activities.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Geocortex.Mobile.Composition;
using Geocortex.Workflow.Runtime;
using Geocortex.Workflow.Runtime.Definition;
using Geocortex.Workflow.Runtime.Execution;
using App1.Workflow;

[assembly: Export(typeof(ActivityLoader), SingleInstance = true, AsImplementedInterfaces = true)]
namespace App1.Workflow
{
    public class ActivityLoader : IActivityHandlerFactory
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Gets a mapping of action names to implementations of <see cref="IActivityHandler"/>s.
        /// </summary>
        private Dictionary<string, Func<IActivityHandler>> RegisteredActivities { get; } = new Dictionary<string, Func<IActivityHandler>>();

        public ActivityLoader()
        {
            RegisteredActivities[CalculateLog.Action] = () => new CalculateLog();
        }

        /// <summary>
        /// Creates an <see cref="IActivityHandler"/>.
        /// </summary>
        /// <param name="action">The name of the action to create.</param>
        /// <param name="token">The cancellation token.</param>
        /// <param name="inspector">The <see cref="ProgramInspector"/> for the program.</param>
        /// <returns>The activity handler for the given action.</returns>
        public Task<IActivityHandler> Create(string action, CancellationToken token, ProgramInspector inspector = null)
        {
            if (action == null || token.IsCancellationRequested)
            {
                return Task.FromResult<IActivityHandler>(null);
            }

            if (RegisteredActivities.TryGetValue(action, out Func<IActivityHandler> handlerType))
            {
                return Task.FromResult(handlerType());
            }
            else
            {
                return Task.FromResult<IActivityHandler>(null);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

:::info
Two key components of this snippet are the `[assembly: Export(...)]` tag and the class extension `ActivityLoader : IActivityHandlerFactory`. These two pieces register the `ActivityLoader` with Geocortex Mobile and cause it to be initialized on startup.

## Implement the Custom Activity

We now have a empty activity that Geocortex Mobile can use that takes no inputs and produces no outputs. At this point, you can implement the appropiate business logic for your use case, using the features available with [.NET Standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard). This activity still does not have an [easy to use interface in Geocortex Workflow Designer](register-dotnet-activities.mdx), but can be executed using [`RunActivity`](https://docs.geocortex.com/workflow/latest/help/Default.htm#wf5/help/activities/run-activity.htm%3FTocPath%3DActivities%7CActivity%2520Reference%7C_____167).

### Example: Logarithm of a Number

The follow activity will calculate the log of a number with a given (optional) base.

:::note
Activity inputs should be [validated with the `Ensure*` methods](activity-input-validation.mdx).

## Test and Deploy your Activity

You can run your new activity by configuring a button to run a workflow in Geocortex Mobile. An example of how this can be done can be found in the [SDK Samples](https://github.com/geocortex/sdk-samples/workflow/run-workflow). The [`RunActivity`](https://docs.geocortex.com/workflow/latest/help/Default.htm#wf5/help/activities/run-activity.htm%3FTocPath%3DActivities%7CActivity%2520Reference%7C_____167) activity can be used to execute your activity by the name defined in `CustomActivity.cs` (for this example, `custom:wf:app::CustomActivity`).

<!-- TODO: Validate SDK samples link when available -->
