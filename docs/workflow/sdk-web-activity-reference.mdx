## Inputs and Outputs

The `execute` method of an activity class has typed inputs and outputs. These inputs and outputs are decorated with [block tags](sdk-web-activity-block-tags.mdx) to provide display hints in Geocortex Workflow Designer.

```ts title="src/activities/CustomActivity.ts"
import type { IActivityHandler } from "@geocortex/workflow/runtime/IActivityHandler";

/** An interface that defines the inputs of the activity. */
export interface CustomActivityInputs {
    // highlight-start
    // @description The first input to the activity.
    // @required
    // highlight-end
    input1?: string;

    // highlight-start
    // @description The second input to the activity.
    // highlight-end
    input2?: number;
}

/** An interface that defines the outputs of the activity. */
export interface CustomActivityOutputs {
    /** A result of the activity. */
    // highlight-start
    // @description The result of the activity.
    // highlight-end
    result: string;
}

// @category Custom Activities
// @description A description of the activity.
export class CustomActivity implements IActivityHandler {
    // Perform the execution logic of the activity.
    async execute(
        inputs: CustomActivityInputs
    ): Promise<CustomActivityOutputs> {
        return { result: "test" };
    }
}
```

## App Activities

The Geocortex Workflow TypeScript SDK has a concept of an `AppActivity`, which is an activity that needs access to its [host](key-concepts.mdx#geocortex-workflow-hosts).

Activities that extend the `AppActivity` gain access to the `map`, `app`, or `widget` properties.

:::note
Depending on the type of host application, different resources will be available. For example, Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS is the only platform which has access to the `widget` property.
:::

```ts
// highlight-next-line
import { AppActivity } from "@geocortex/workflow/runtime/app/AppActivity";

// @supportedApps GWV
// @category Custom Activities
// @description An activity which adds a graphics layer to a map.
// highlight-next-line
export class CustomAppActivity extends AppActivity {
    // Perform the execution logic of the activity.
    async execute(inputs: object): Promise<void> {
        // highlight-next-line
        // This function has access to the this.map, this.app, and this.widget properties.
        // ...
    }
}
```
