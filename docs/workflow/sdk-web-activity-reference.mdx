In the Geocortex Workflow TypeScript SDK, activities are represented as simple classes with an `execute` method.

```ts
// @displayName MyCustomActivity
// @category Custom Activities
export class MyCustomActivity {
    // The unique identifier of the activity.
    static action =
        "uuid:5ab188eb-dc0d-42c7-bc3a-57cdcda0adcb::MyCustomActivity";

    // The identifier of the suite of activities that this activity belongs to.
    static suite = "uuid:5ab188eb-dc0d-42c7-bc3a-57cdcda0adcb";

    // Perform the execution logic of the activity.
    async execute(
        inputs: MyCustomActivityInputs
    ): Promise<MyCustomActivityOutputs> {
        return { result: "test" };
    }
}
```

## Registering Activities

The recommended method of creating and registering a new activity is through the `npm run activity` script.

1. The script will perform the following operations:
    1. Create a new activity `.ts` file with the provided name in the `src/activities` folder.
    1. Populate the activity `.ts` file from an activity template.
    1. Register the activity in `src/index.ts`.

:::tip
It's convention to use PascalCase for activity names.
You can add many activities to the same project.

## Inputs and Outputs

The `execute` method of an activity class has typed inputs and outputs. These inputs and outputs are decorated with [block tags](sdk-web-activity-block-tags.mdx) to provide display hints in Geocortex Workflow Designer.

```ts title="src/activities/CustomActivity.ts"
/** An interface that defines the inputs of the activity. */
export interface CustomActivityInputs {
    // @description The first input to the activity.
    // @required
    input1?: string;

    // @description The second input to the activity.
    input2?: number;
}

/** An interface that defines the outputs of the activity. */
export interface CustomActivityOutputs {
    /** A result of the activity. */
    // @description The result of the activity.
    result: string;
}

// @category Custom Activities
// @description A description of the activity.
export class CustomActivity {
    static action = "your:unique:namespace::CustomActivity";

    static suite = "your:unique:namespace";

    // Perform the execution logic of the activity.
    // highlight-start
    async execute(
        inputs: CustomActivityInputs
    ): Promise<CustomActivityOutputs> {
        return { result: "test" };
    }
    // highlight-end
}
```

## App Activities

The Geocortex Workflow TypeScript SDK has a concept of an `AppActivity`, which is an activity that needs access to its [host](concepts-key-concepts.mdx#geocortex-workflow-hosts).

Activities that extend the `AppActivity` gain access to the `map`, `app`, or `widget` properties.

:::note
Depending on the type of host application, different resources will be available. For example, Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS is the only platform which has access to the `widget` property.
:::

```ts
// highlight-next-line
import { AppActivity } from "@geocortex/workflow/runtime/app/AppActivity";

// @supportedApps GWV
// @category Custom Activities
// @description An activity which adds a graphics layer to a map.
// highlight-next-line
export class CustomAppActivity extends AppActivity {
    static action = "your:unique:namespace::AddLayerToMap";

    static suite = "your:unique:namespace";

    // Perform the execution logic of the activity.
    async execute(inputs: object): Promise<void> {
        // highlight-next-line
        // This function has access to the this.map, this.app, and this.widget properties.
        // ...
        return;
    }
}
```
