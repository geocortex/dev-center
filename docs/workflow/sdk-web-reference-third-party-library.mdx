import WebPrereqs from "./snippets/prereqs-web.mdx";

You can reference external JavaScript libraries to augment [custom activities](tutorial-web-calculate-logarithm-activity.mdx) or [custom form elements](tutorial-web-implement-star-rating-form-element.mdx).

## Prerequisites

<WebPrereqs />

## Adding a Dependency

1. Install the dependency in the activity sdk. For example, `npm install moment`.
2. **Copy** the dependency to `dist/deps/`.

:::important
It's important that you **copy** and not move the dependency from the `node_modules` folder, as this will make it accessible to both the development server and production activity pack.
:::

3. Add a call to `mapDependencies()` to the `configure()` method in `src/main.ts`.

For example, if you wanted to use the [moment.js](https://github.com/moment/moment) library and had the file `moment.js` located in a folder called `deps/moment` within the `dist` folder, you would write the following:

```ts
import { mapDependencies } from "@geocortex/workflow/runtime/app/ActivityPackUtils";

function configure(prefix: string) {
    mapDependencies({ moment: "/deps/moment/moment" }, prefix);
}
```

The root that the library path refers to is the `dist` folder, and the `.js` suffix on the library file should be omitted.

4. Import and use the library as you normally would use a javascript library. This example demonstrates a custom activity that uses the `moment.js` library to return the current date and time in a human readable format.

```ts
import * as moment from "moment";

// @category Custom Activities
// @description An activity that returns the current dat and time.
export class CurrentTime {
    static action = "your:unique:namespace::CurrentTime";

    static suite = "your:unique:namespace";

    async execute(): Promise<string> {
        return moment().format("dddd, MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a");
    }
}
```

:::important
If the external dependency has other dependencies, you will need to call `mapDependencies` for each one.
:::

## Reference External React Components

If your Activity Pack contains a custom form element that relies upon an external React component, you need to add a call to `mapDependencies()` to the `configure()` method in `src/main.ts`, the same as for other external libraries.

<!--
TODO: This library is very outdated, and will start causing `npm install` errors when we upgrade to React 16 in the SDK.
It doesn't support React 16. Let's pick something more popular perhaps? https://geocortex.visualstudio.com/Geocortex/_workitems/edit/39715
-->

### Example: Using the [react-circular-color](https://github.com/ubcent/react-circular-color) Component.

1. Run `npm install react-circular-color` in the terminal.
2. Follow the instructions above to create and register a new custom form element `ColorPicker.tsx` React component that just returns a single color picker.

```ts
import { CustomFormElementProps } from "@geocortex/workflow/runtime/app/RegisterCustomFormElementBase";
import * as React from "react";
import CircularColor from "react-circular-color";

export default class ColorPicker extends React.Component<
    CustomFormElementProps
> {
    render() {
        return <CircularColor size={200} />;
    }
}
```

3. Copy the `react-circular-color` folder from your `node_modules` to `dist/deps`
4. Add a call for `react-circular-color` to `mapDependencies()` to the `configure()` method in `src/main.ts`.

```ts
import { mapDependencies } from "@geocortex/workflow/runtime/app/ActivityPackUtils";

function configure(prefix: string) {
    mapDependencies(
        { "react-circular-color": "/deps/react-circular-color/build/index" },
        prefix
    );
}
```

## Limitations

There are some limitations on the types of component you can load:

-   You can only import components that are defined using the [AMD or UMD](https://www.davidbcalhoun.com/2014/what-is-amd-commonjs-and-umd/) syntax.
-   You cannot import components defined using the [CommonJS](http://requirejs.org/docs/commonjs.html) syntax.
