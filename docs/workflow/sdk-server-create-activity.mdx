This article will walk you through creating a new workflow activity for Geocortex Workflow Server.

## Prerequisites

<ServerPrereqs />

## Create the Activity

1. Create a new file `CustomActivity.cs` in the root of your Geocortex Workflow Server extension project.
2. Add a new skeleton workflow activity that implements `IActivityHandler`.

```cs title="App1/App1/CustomActivity.cs"
using Geocortex.Workflow.Runtime;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace App1.Workflow
{
    public class CustomActivity : IActivityHandler
    {
        public static string Action { get; } = "your:unique:namespace::CustomActivity";

        public Task<IDictionary<string, object>> Execute(IDictionary<string, object> inputs, IActivityContext context)
        {
            return Task.FromResult((IDictionary<string, object>)new Dictionary<string, object>(){
                ["test"] = "value"
            });
        }
    }
}
```

## Register the Activity with an Assembly Attribute

1. Create a new file, `Properties\AssemblyInfo.cs`
1. Add the custom Geocortex Workflow attribute to `AssemblyInfo.cs`:

```cs title="App1/App1/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs"
[assembly: Geocortex.Workflow.Runtime.WorkflowActivities]
```

This registers the assembly to a namespace that Geocortex Workflow Server can discover.

:::note
By convention, assembly attributes are typically added to a file called `"Properties\AssemblyInfo.cs"`, but they can be added to any code file.
:::

## Deploy the Activity

Follow the instructions to [deploy Geocortex Workflow Server activities](sdk-server-overview.mdx#deploying-geocortex-workflow-server-activities).

## Use the Activity in a Workflow

[Server workflows](https://docs.geocortex.com/workflow/latest/help/Default.htm#wf5/help/server-workflows.htm) that run on your Geocortex Workflow Server deployment can now run this custom activity.

:::tip
[Registering stubs for .NET activities](sdk-net-register-activities.mdx) provides a user friendly interface for your custom activities in Geocortex Workflow Designer.
:::

You can run the custom activity by referencing it by action with [the `RunActivity` activity](https://docs.geocortex.com/workflow/latest/help/Default.htm#wf5/help/activities/run-activity.htm). The custom activity created in this article takes no inputs but produces an output with the property "test".
