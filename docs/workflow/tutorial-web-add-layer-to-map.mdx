title: Add a Layer to a Map with an Activity

Some activities may need access to resources like the map, the host application or host widget. The `AppActivity` base class can be used to extend an existing activity to access these resources.

This article will walk you through creating a custom activity that adds a new layer to the map.

## Prerequisites

<WebPrereqs />

## Setup the Activity

1. Open up a terminal shell in the SDK folder.
1. Run the command `npm run activity` and create a new activity `AddLayerToMap`.

## Modify the Activity to Access App Properties

1. Add an import for the `AppActivity` base class at the top of the `AddLayerToMap.ts` file.  
   `import { AppActivity } from "@geocortex/workflow/runtime/app/AppActivity";`
1. Modify the activity class declaration to extend the `AppActivity` base class.  
   `export class AddLayerToMap extends AppActivity`

```ts title="src/activities/AddLayerToMap.ts"
// highlight-next-line
import { AppActivity } from "@geocortex/workflow/runtime/app/AppActivity";

// @supportedApps GWV
// @category Custom Activities
// @description An activity which adds a graphics layer to a map.
// highlight-next-line
export class AddLayerToMap extends AppActivity {
    static action = "your:unique:namespace::AddLayerToMap";

    static suite = "your:unique:namespace";

    // Perform the execution logic of the activity.
    async execute(inputs: object): Promise<void> {
        return;
    }
}
```

## Add a New Map Layer with the Activity

Next, we can use the [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET](sdk-web-integrating-the-arcgis-api.mdx) and the `AppActivity` class to create a graphics layer and add it to the host's map through the `this.map` property.

:::note
This activity assumes that it will be running in Geocortex Web, and so [it uses the 4.x ArcGIS API for Javascript](sdk-web-integrating-the-arcgis-api.mdx#change-the-api-version-used-by-the-activity-sdk).
:::

```ts title="src/activities/AddLayerToMap.ts"
import { AppActivity } from "@geocortex/workflow/runtime/app/AppActivity";
// highlight-start
import * as Map from "esri/Map";
import * as Graphic from "esri/Graphic";
import * as GraphicsLayer from "esri/layers/GraphicsLayer";
import * as Polyline from "esri/geometry/Polyline";
import * as LineSymbol from "esri/symbols/LineSymbol";
// highlight-end

// @supportedApps GWV
// @category Custom Activities
// @description An activity which adds a graphics layer to a map.
export class AddLayerToMap extends AppActivity {
    static action = "your:unique:namespace::AddLayerToMap";

    static suite = "your:unique:namespace";

    // Perform the execution logic of the activity.
    async execute(inputs: object): Promise<void> {
        var polylineGraphic = new Graphic({
            geometry: new Polyline({
                paths: [
                    [
                        [-111.3, 52.68],
                        [-98, 49.5],
                        [-93.94, 29.89],
                    ],
                ],
            }),
            symbol: new LineSymbol({
                color: [226, 119, 40],
                width: 4,
            }),
        });

        var graphicsLayer = new GraphicsLayer({
            graphics: [polylineGraphic],
        });

        // highlight-next-line
        (this.map as Map).add(graphicsLayer);

        return;
    }
}
```

## Deploy the Activity

Follow the instructions to [build the activity pack](sdk-web-overview.mdx#building) and [deploy it](sdk-web-overview.mdx#deployment).

## Test the Activity

Once your activity pack is hosted and registered, your custom activity should appear in the activity toolbox in Geocortex Workflow Designer alongside the built-in activities, and can be used in the graphical interface like any other activity.

Now you can build a workflow that uses your new custom activity!
