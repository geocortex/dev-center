title: Integrating the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET
description: Geocortex Workflow - Integrate the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET into custom activities for .NET applications
---

[Geocortex Workflow](https://apps.geocortex.com/workflow/designer/) was designed to be a flexible tool for implementing business logic for mapping applications, and tightly integrates with ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET. You may want to use the ArcGIS Runtime SDK in your own custom activities; this article will explain how to reference ArcGIS Runtime SDK types in your custom activity or custom form elements for .NET applications.

## Scope

This article applies to building workflow activities and form elements that will be run in [.NET workflow hosts](concepts-key-concepts.mdx#geocortex-workflow-hosts).

## Geocortex Mobile

The Geocortex Mobile [Quickstart](../mobile/sdk-getting-started.mdx) already references the [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/api-reference/), so integrating the ArcGIS API is as easy as adding a `using` statement to the top of your custom activity or form element.

For example,

```c#
using Esri.ArcGISRuntime.Data;
```

## Geocortex Workflow Server

It is **not possible** to reference the [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/api-reference/) in Geocortex Workflow Server, as the licensing does not allow for this usage.

:::tip
Consider using the [Geoprocessing activities](https://docs.geocortex.com/workflow/latest/help/Default.htm#wf5/help/geometries.htm#Work_with_Geometries%3FTocPath%3DWork%2520with%2520Geometries%7C_____0) in a client workflow or the [`Run Python`](https://docs.geocortex.com/workflow/latest/help/Default.htm#wf5/help/activities/run-python.htm%3FTocPath%3DActivities%7CActivity%2520Reference%7C_____174) activity on the server to have your workflow offload any operations that require server processing of ArcGIS types.
