Geocortex Workflow has a .NET runtime for executing workflows in a .NET environment. [Geocortex Mobile](https://docs.geocortex.com/mobileviewer/) and [Geocortex Workflow Server](https://docs.geocortex.com/workflow/latest/help/Default.htm#wf5/help/server-workflows.htm) both run workflows in a .NET environment.

Workflows for Geocortex Mobile and Geocortex Workflow Server are still authored in the [Geocortex Workflow Designer](https://apps.geocortex.com/workflow/designer/). Custom .NET workflow activities can be executed by name with the [Run Activity](https://docs.geocortex.com/workflow/latest/help/Default.htm#wf5/help/activities/run-activity.htm) activity. In addition, the Geocortex Workflow Typescript SDK can be used to create [activity stubs](sdk-net-register-activities.mdx) that give a user friendly interface for custom .NET workflow activities.
