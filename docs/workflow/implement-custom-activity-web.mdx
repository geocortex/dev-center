Implementing a custom [activity](concepts-key-concepts.mdx#activities-and-form-elements) allows you to a build a reusable, completely custom behaviour to augment the [existing activities](https://docs.geocortex.com/workflow/latest/help/Default.htm#wf5/help/activity-reference.htm%3FTocPath%3DActivities%7CActivity%2520Reference%7C_____0) that come with Geocortex Workflow.

## Scope

This article applies to any web application that uses the JavaScript Workflow runtime, such as Geocortex Web, Geocortex Viewer for HTML5, and Web App Builder.

## Setup Activity Skeleton

To create a new activity:

1. Open the Workflow activity SDK in Visual Studio Code
1. Run `npm run activity` in the terminal.
1. When prompted enter the name of the activity you would like to create and press `Enter`. For example, `CustomActivity`.

:::tip
It's convention to use PascalCase for activity names.
You can add many activities to the same project.
:::

1. The script will perform the following operations:
    1. Create a new activity .ts file with the provided name in the `src/activities` folder.
    1. Populate the activity .ts file from an activity template.
    1. Register the activity in `src/index.ts`.
1. Open the newly created `src/activities/CustomActivity.ts` file.

```ts
/** An interface that defines the inputs of the activity. */
export interface CustomActivityInputs {
    // @displayName Input 1
    // @description The first input to the activity.
    // @required
    input1?: string;

    // @displayName Input 2
    // @description The second input to the activity.
    input2?: number;
}

/** An interface that defines the outputs of the activity. */
export interface CustomActivityOutputs {
    /** A result of the activity. */
    // @description The result of the activity.
    result: string;
}

// @displayName CustomActivity
// @category Custom Activities
// @description A description of the activity.
export class CustomActivity {
    // The unique identifier of the activity.
    // This value should not be changed once an activity has been published.
    static action = "uuid:a1c505cb-c725-465c-9ca1-f11a5316dfec::CustomActivity";

    // The identifier of the suite of activities that this activity belongs to.
    // This value should not be changed once an activity has been published.
    static suite = "uuid:a1c505cb-c725-465c-9ca1-f11a5316dfec";

    // Perform the execution logic of the activity.
    async execute(inputs: CustomActivityInputs): Promise<CustomActivityOutputs> {
        return { result: "test" };
    }
}
```

## Implement the Activity

The `npm run activity` script creates a custom activity with some dummy inputs and outputs. It also has examples of the various [decorators](typescript-activity-decorators.mdx) that are used to describe activity metadata. By changing the inputs, outputs, execute logic, and decorators, you can create your own custom activity that has an easy to use interface in the Geocortex Workflow Designer.

### Example: Logarithm of a Number

The follow activity will calculate the log of a number with a given (optional) base.

```ts
export interface CalculateLogInputs {
    // @displayName Base
    // @description The base of the logarithm. Defaults to the natural log.
    base?: number;

    // @displayName Value
    // @description The number to calculate the logarithm for.
    // @required
    value: number;
}

export interface CalculateLogOutputs {
    // @description The logarithm output.
    result: number;
}

// @displayName CalculateLog
// @category Custom Activities
// @description An activity that calculates the log of a number with the given base.
export class CalculateLog {
    static action = "uuid:a1c505cb-c725-465c-9ca1-f11a5316dfec::CalculateLog";

    static suite = "uuid:a1c505cb-c725-465c-9ca1-f11a5316dfec";

    async execute(inputs: CalculateLogInputs): Promise<CalculateLogOutputs> {
        return {
            result:
                Math.log(inputs.value) / (inputs.base !== undefined ? Math.log(inputs.base) : 1),
        };
    }
}
```

## Test and Deploy the Activity

See the [SDK documentation](getting-started-web.mdx#building) for details on building and deploying your custom activities.

## Next Steps

Now you know how to build a basic Workflow activity for web applications. Next, you can learn how to use the ArcGIS API for JavaScript in your activities, reference other third party libraries, build custom form elements, and more.
