Geocortex Workflow is a flexible tool for turning turning sophisticated business processes into a set of simple, guided end-user interactions. Geocortex Workflow is part of the [Geocortex suite of products](https://www.geocortex.com/products/).

Geocortex Workflow allows you to integrate geographic information and processing with other business tasks to create sophisticated functionality for your applications. For example, you could create a workflow that produces a tax parcel report for the user, or you could create a workflow that gets information about the geology and nearby features of a survey location specified by the user. The possibilities are endless—from automated reporting, to complex spatial analytics, to specific and tailored search experiences, you can use Geocortex Workflow for almost any process that you want to streamline and automate for your users.

Geocortex Workflow was designed to be cross-platform, and it can run in [Geocortex Web](https://www.geocortex.com/products/gxw/), [Geocortex Mobile](https://www.geocortex.com/products/gxm/), [Geocortex Viewer for HTML5](https://docs.geocortex.com/essentials/gvh/), on [ArcGIS Web App Builder](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/web-appbuilder/overview), or on a [Geocortex Workflow Server](https://docs.geocortex.com/workflow/latest/help/Default.htm#wf5/help/server-workflows.htm%3FTocPath%3DServer%2520Workflows%7C_____0).
