[VertiGIS Studio Workflow](https://www.vertigisstudio.com/products/vertigis-studio-workflow/) is a flexible tool for turning turning sophisticated business processes into a set of simple, guided end-user interactions. VertiGIS Studio Workflow is part of the [VertiGIS Studio suite of products](https://www.vertigisstudio.com/products/).

VertiGIS Studio Workflow allows you to integrate geographic information and processing with other business tasks to create sophisticated functionality for your applications. For example, you could create a workflow that produces a tax parcel report for the user, or you could create a workflow that gets information about the geology and nearby features of a survey location specified by the user. The possibilities are endless—from automated reporting, to complex spatial analytics, to specific and tailored search experiences, you can use VertiGIS Studio Workflow for almost any process that you want to streamline and automate for your users.

VertiGIS Studio Workflow was designed to be cross-platform, and it can run in [VertiGIS Studio Web](https://www.vertigisstudio.com/products/vertigis-studio-web/), [VertiGIS Studio Mobile](https://www.vertigisstudio.com/products/vertigis-studio-mobile/), [Geocortex Viewer for HTML5](https://docs.vertigisstudio.com/essentials/gvh/), on [Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/web-appbuilder/overview), or on a [VertiGIS Studio Workflow Server](https://docs.vertigisstudio.com/workflow/latest/help/Default.htm#wf5/help/server-workflows.htm%3FTocPath%3DServer%2520Workflows%7C_____0).

## Start with the Concepts

VertiGIS Studio Workflow is built on the concept of a [**workflow**](key-concepts.mdx#workflow). A workflow is a collection of connected **activities** and **forms**, that can be created using VertiGIS Studio Workflow Designer.

-   [Workflow **activities**](key-concepts.mdx#activities) are the building blocks of a workflow. They allow you to perform actions in sequence that interact with the application and the end user, capturing your business logic in a reusable, easy to understand format.

-   [Workflow **forms**](key-concepts.mdx#form-elements) allow the creation of a customizable form that can be displayed to an end user. When combined with activities, you can create powerful experiences which can automate any number of manual processes in your applications.

The VertiGIS Studio Workflow Runtime is the engine which runs these generic workflows on multiple platforms, including VertiGIS Studio Web and VertiGIS Studio Mobile.
