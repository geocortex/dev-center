description: Geocortex Workflow - Validate activity input in .NET custom activities
---

## Scope

This article applies to building workflow activities that will be run in [.NET workflow hosts](concepts-key-concepts.mdx#geocortex-workflow-hosts).

## Activity Input Validation Helpers

When you build a custom activity with inputs, you need to validate those inputs to ensure the user provided them and that they are of the same type. The .NET workflow runtime provides a number of helper functions to make this easier.

1. Add the line `using Geocortex.Workflow.Runtime.Utils;` to the top of your activity file.
1. Use intellisense to examine the new methods available on the `inputs` dictionary passed into the activity, such as `EnsureBool`, or `EnsureDoubleStrict`.

:::note
The difference between strict and non-strict validators is that strict validators will throw if the value is not present or if it is the wrong type, while non-strict validators will just soft fail.
:::

Use these `Ensure*` methods to validate your activity inputs and provide useful error methods. Check out the [logarithm activity](implement-custom-activity-mobile.mdx#example-logarithm-of-a-number) in Geocortex Mobile for an example.
