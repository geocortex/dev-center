:::note
We recommend that you only implement the <code>IActivityHandler</code> interface examples provided in the Developer Center. These examples have been verified and are provided to help you customize your VertiGIS Studio product to suit your needs. You should not reference other classes and functions from the various VertiGIS Studio Workflow assemblies. Doing so could risk breaking functionality and/or unexpected results as a result of future changes.
