As discussed in [Geocortex Workflow Server](sdk-net-getting-started-server.mdx#setting-up-a-geocortex-workflow-server-extension-project), deploying a custom activity to Geocortex Workflow Server involves creating a .NET project that generates compatible assemblies and then copying them to the build folder. Add a third party assembly is as simply as adding the library to your .NET project and then ensuring it is copied along with the user defined code.

## Set up your Custom Code

Follow the instructions in [implement custom activity](usecases-server-implement-custom-activity.mdx) to implement and deploy a basic custom activity.

## Add a Third Party library

Add a third party library via a nuget package, and use it in your custom activity.

## Build and Copy the Project Output

Build the project to output the user and referenced assemblies. Follow the instructions to [Deploy the Activity](usecases-server-implement-custom-activity.mdx#deploy-the-activity). Ensure that you locate and copy the third party assemblies. If you don't see them in the build output folder, review the instructions and ensure you have followed all the steps.

:::important
An important step not to miss is adding the `CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies` attribute to the `.csproj` file if you created a .NET Standard class library. Without this attribute, your nuget package reference assemblies will not be output to the build folder.
