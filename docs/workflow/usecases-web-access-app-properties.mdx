title: Access App Properties in an Activity
description: Geocortex Workflow - Access app properties in a web applications workflow activity
---

## Prerequisites

Learn how to build a [custom activity](usecases-web-implement-custom-activity.mdx) for web applications before reading this article.

## App Activities

Some activities may need access to resources like the map, the host application or host widget. The `AppActivity` base class can be used to extend an existing custom activity to access these resources.

:::note
Depending on the type of host application different resources will be available. For example, Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS is the only platform which has access to the `widget` property.
:::

1. Add an import for the `AppActivity` base class at the top of your activity `.ts(x)` file.  
   `import { AppActivity } from "@geocortex/workflow/runtime/app/AppActivity";`
1. Modify the activity class declaration to extend the `AppActivity` base class.  
   `export class CustomActivity extends AppActivity`
1. Use the `map`, `app` or `widget` properties of the activity class within the `execute(inputs)` method.

## Example: Custom Activity that Adds a Layer to the Map

The following activity uses [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET](sdk-web-integrating-the-arcgis-api.mdx) and the `AppActivity` class to create a graphics layer and add it to the host's map. This activity assumes that it will be running in Geocortex Web, and so [it uses the 4.x ArcGIS API for Javascript](sdk-web-integrating-the-arcgis-api.mdx#change-the-api-version-used-by-the-activity-sdk).

```ts
import { AppActivity } from "@geocortex/workflow/runtime/app/AppActivity";
import * as Map from "esri/Map";
import * as Graphic from "esri/Graphic";
import * as GraphicsLayer from "esri/layers/GraphicsLayer";
import * as Polyline from "esri/geometry/Polyline";
import * as LineSymbol from "esri/symbols/LineSymbol";

// @supportedApps GWV
// @category Custom Activities
// @description An activity which adds a graphics layer to a map.
export class AddLayerToMap extends AppActivity {
    static action = "your:unique:namespace::AddLayerToMap";

    static suite = "your:unique:namespace";

    // Perform the execution logic of the activity.
    async execute(inputs: object): Promise<void> {
        var polylineGraphic = new Graphic({
            geometry: new Polyline({
                paths: [
                    [
                        [-111.3, 52.68],
                        [-98, 49.5],
                        [-93.94, 29.89],
                    ],
                ],
            }),
            symbol: new LineSymbol({
                color: [226, 119, 40],
                width: 4,
            }),
        });

        var graphicsLayer = new GraphicsLayer({
            graphics: [polylineGraphic],
        });

        (this.map as Map).add(graphicsLayer);

        return;
    }
}
```
