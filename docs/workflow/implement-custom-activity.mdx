Implementing a custom [activity](concepts-workflow-activities-form-elements#activities) allows you to a build a reusable, completely custom behaviour to augment the [existing activities](https://docs.geocortex.com/workflow/latest/help/Default.htm#wf5/help/activity-reference.htm%3FTocPath%3DActivities%7CActivity%2520Reference%7C_____0) that come with Geocortex Workflow. For workflows targeting Web Applications like Geocortex Viewer for HTML or Web App Builder, activities are implemented in Typescript. For workflows targeting Geocortex Mobile, or for activities used in [Server Workflows](TODO - some sort of link here...) (which can be [run using the "RunWorkflow" activity on any platform](https://docs.geocortex.com/workflow/latest/help/Default.htm#wf5/help/server-workflows.htm#configure-client-workflow). activities are implemented using csharp and the .NET platform).

There's two

<Tabs defaultValue="typescript"
  values={[
    { label: 'Web Based Activities', value: 'web', }
    { label: 'Geocortex Mobile Activities', value: 'mobile', },
    { label: 'Server Side Workflow Activities', value: 'server', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="web">
<WebPrereqs/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mobile">
<MobilePrereqs/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="server">
<ServerPrereqs/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
