:::tip
Geocortex Mobile has many built in [Commands and Operations](concepts-commands-operations) which can be chained together to build custom behaviours with. If these Command and Operations are not enough to accomplish your goal, you can use [Geocortex Workflow](change-default-search-behaviour) to take custom behaviour even further without writing custom code. If Workflow is still not enough to accomplish your needs, then it might be time to implement a Custom Command / Operation.
:::

This article will walk you through implementing a custom command in Geocortex Mobile that displays an alert.

## Create the Backing Service

Every Command or operation in Geocortex Mobile needs to be registered and implemented by a [service or component](concepts-components-services), so the first thing we will do is create a service.

1. Create a new file `Services/AlertService.cs` under the platform agnostic project.
2. In the file, add a new service class `AlertService` and register it with **autofac**

<AutofacSnippet />

```csharp
using App1.Services.AlertService;
using Geocortex.Mobile.Composition;
using Geocortex.Mobile.Composition.Services;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

[assembly: Service(typeof(Service), PropertiesAutowired = true)]
namespace App1.Services.AlertService
{
    class AlertService : ServiceBase
    {
        protected override Task DoInitialize()
        {
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }
    }
}
```

:::info
The two key components of this snippet are the `[assembly: Service(...)]` tag and the class extension `AlertService: ServiceBase`. These two pieces register the service with autofac and Geocortex Mobile and cause it to be initialized on startup.
:::

3. Create a class `Services/AlertOperations` under the platform agnostic project
4. In the file, add a new class `AlertOperations` and register it with autofac

```csharp
using App1.Services.AlertOperations;
using Geocortex.Mobile.Composition;
using Geocortex.Mobile.Composition.Messaging;
using Geocortex.Mobile.Infrastructure.Messaging;

[assembly: Export(typeof(AlertOperations), SingleInstance = true)]
namespace App1.Services.AlertOperations
{
    class AlertOperations : OperationsBase
    {
        public AlertOperations(IOperationRegistry operationRegistry)
            : base(operationRegistry)
        {
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementing the Operation

Creating a new Operation in mobile consists of two pieces.

-   Defining the Operation's name, inputs, and outputs
-   Registering an "Execution" function for the operation.
    -   This function will be the actual code that executes when the operation is called.

### Define the Operation

An Operation is defined in the class that extends `OperationsBase`. In our example, it's `AlertOperations`.

-   An `IVoidOperation` produces no output, and optionally takes an input

```csharp
public IVoidOperation NoInputNoOutput => GetVoidOperation("fire.phasers");
public IVoidOperation<Temperature> SomeInputNoOutput => GetVoidOperation<Temperature>("tea.earl-grey");
```

-   An `IOperation` produces an output, and optionally takes an input

```csharp
public IOperation<Mischief> NoInputSomeOutput => GetOperation<Mischief>("q.appear");
public IOperation<Deuterium, WarpSpeed> SomeInputSomeOutput => GetOperation<Deuterium, WarpSpeed>("warpdrive.engage");
```

:::note
Operation names in mobile generally take the format `<category>.<name>`, with multiple words `kebab-cased`.
:::

For this example, let's define a operation with some input and no output.

```csharp
class AlertOperations : OperationsBase
{
    public IVoidOperation<string> DisplayCustomAlert => GetVoidOperation<string>("custom-alert.display");

    public AlertOperations(IOperationRegistry operationRegistry)
        : base(operationRegistry)
    {
    }
}
```

### Register an Implementation for the Operation

Next, we need to register an implementation for our operation in the `AlertService`.

1. Add a public property `AlertOperations` to the Service.

```csharp
    [assembly: Service(typeof(Service), PropertiesAutowired = true)]
    class AlertService : ServiceBase
    {
        public AlertOperations AlertOperations { get; set; }
        ...
    }
```

:::note
We never have to explicity set this property because of some [autofac autowiring magic](https://autofaccn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/register/prop-method-injection.html) in the assembly attribute.
:::

2. Create an implementation for displaying a custom alert and register it as an execution for the operation.

```csharp
class AlertService : ServiceBase
{
    public AlertOperations AlertOperations { get; set; }

    protected override Task DoInitialize()
    {
        this.AlertOperations.DisplayCustomAlert.RegisterExecute(
            (args) =>
            {
                Application.Current.MainPage.DisplayAlert("Custom Alert", args, "OK");
                return Task.FromResult((object)null);
            }, this);

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

:::note
Multiple implementations can be registered for an Command or Operation.
:::

Congradulations! You just created your first custom operation. You can easily test your new operation by setting it to [run it on map initialization](change-default-behaviour).

```json
{
    "items": [
        ...
        {
            "$type": "map-extension",
            "id": "map1",
            "webMap": "c6008288a95247428fc55d9aaa72b670",
            "onClick": [ "tasks.identify", "highlights.pulse", "results.display" ],
            "onInitialized": [
                {
                    "name": "custom-alert.display",
                    "arguments": "This is a custom operation!"
                }
            ]
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

## Next Steps

Commands and operations are the logical building blocks of executing custom behaviour in Geocortex Mobile, but sometimes you need to take things a bit further. Creating custom components can allow you to design completely custom UI for Gecortex Mobile, and creating background services can enable the execution of tasks on an arbitrary schedule.
