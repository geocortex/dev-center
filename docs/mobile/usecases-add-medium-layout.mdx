import PrereqsSnippet from "./snippets/prereqs.mdx";

The Geocortex Mobile [Quickstart](sdk-quick-start.mdx) comes with a [small and large layout](concepts-layout.mdx#device-form-factors). This use case will walk you through creating a medium form factor layout.

## Prerequisites

<PrereqsSnippet />

## Create the Layout File

Add a new file `layout-medium.xml` to the platform agnostic project.

Copy the content from `layout-large.xml` into the `layout-medium.xml`.

## Include the Layout File in each project

Add the `layout-medium.xml` file as an asset to each project.

### Android

1. Add the existing file `layout-medium.xml` [as an link](https://jeremybytes.blogspot.com/2019/07/linking-files-in-visual-studio.html) to the `Assets` folder.
2. Ensure the build action for the file is `AndroidAsset`

### iOS

1. Add the existing file `layout-medium.xml` [as an link](https://jeremybytes.blogspot.com/2019/07/linking-files-in-visual-studio.html) to the `Resources` folder.
2. Ensure the build action for the file is `BundleResource`

### UWP

1. Add the existing file `layout-medium.xml` [as an link](https://jeremybytes.blogspot.com/2019/07/linking-files-in-visual-studio.html) to the `Assets` folder.
2. Ensure the build action for the file is `Content`

## Reference the Medium Layout in the `app.json`

Add the new layout as an **app item** to the [`app.json`](sdk-quick-start.mdx#editing-the-layout-and-app-config) that references the medium layout.

```json
{
    "$schema": "..\\..\\ViewerFramework\\app-config\\mobile\\mobile-app-config.schema.json",
    "schemaVersion": "1.0",
    "items": [
        ...
        {
            "$type": "layout",
            "id": "tablet-layout",
            "url": "resource://layout-medium.xml",
            "tags": [ "mobile", "medium" ]
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

:::tip
An easy way to test your new layout when developing on a Windows Device is to temporarily remove the small and large layouts from your `app.json`.
