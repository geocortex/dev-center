## Autocomplete Properties

The `layout.xml` that comes with the [Quickstart](sdk-getting-started.mdx) references a xml schema. This XML schema allows Visual Studio to autocomplete property names and provide linting for types. Two attributes on the layout, `xmlns:xsi`, and `xsi:schemaLocation` allow this to happen. If you move the `layout.xml` files, you will need to adjust the relative reference to the layout schema for autocomplete to still function.

:::note
The `ViewerFramework` folder containing the schema will not be created until an initial build has been run.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<layout
    xmlns="https://geocortex.com/layout/v1"
    xmlns:gxm="https://geocortex.com/layout/mobile/v1"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="https://geocortex.com/layout/v1 ../../ViewerFramework/layout/layout-mobile.xsd">
    ...
</layout>
```

## Nested Model Imports

In previous layout examples, layouts were shown where components related to a map, such as zoom buttons, were nested within a map. It was assumed that the component would bind to the map it was placed in, but why?

```xml
    <map config="map1" slot="main">
      <stack margin="0.5" slot="bottom-right" halign="end">
        <zoom margin="0.8"/>
        <geolocate id="geolocator" margin="0.5" config="geolocate" />
      </stack>
    </map>
```

Certain components, such as `<zoom/>` or `<geolocate/>`, require a `Map Model` to function. To locate a `Map Model`, the layout tree heirachy will be searched upwards, starting at the requesting component. When a element in the layout is found that provides the required model, (in this case, the `<map/>` component provides a Map Model), the requesting component will import the model. If the correct model is not found on an upwards search, a breadth first search will be performed from the root of the layout tree.

Take this more complicated layout for example.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<layout
    xmlns="https://geocortex.com/layout/v1"
    xmlns:gxm="https://geocortex.com/layout/mobile/v1"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="https://geocortex.com/layout/v1 ../../../../../ViewerFramework/layout/layout-mobile.xsd
      https://geocortex.com/layout/v1 ../../../layout-custom.xsd">
  <gxm:taskbar id="taskbar" orientation="vertical">

    <!-- Taskbar main content -->
    <map id="page1-map1" config="map1" slot="main">
      <gxm:geometry-toolbar slot="top-center-visible" id="geometry-toolbar" config="geometry" margin="0.8" style="map-widget" active="false" />
      <search-new-extent config="search" margin="0.8" slot="top-center-visible" active="false" />
      <stack margin="0.8" slot="top-right" halign="end">
        <iwtm config="iwtm" id="IWTM">
          <user slot="bottom"/>
        </iwtm>
      </stack>
      <stack margin="0.5" slot="bottom-right" halign="end">
        <zoom margin="0.5"/>
        <button config="measureAction" icon="measure" style="map-widget" margin="0.5"/>
        <geolocate id="geolocator" margin="0.5" config="geolocate" />
      </stack>
      <gxm:version slot="bottom-left" margin="0.8"/>
    </map>

    <!-- Taskbar / search -->
    <panel id="search-panel">
      <stack id="search">
        <search config="search"/>
        <results-list config="results" active="false" />
      </stack>
      <feature-details config="feature-details"/>
      <gxm:update-feature/>
      <gxm:add-related-feature />
    </panel>

    <!-- Taskbar / layers -->
    <panel id="layers">
      <layer-list />
    </panel>

    <!-- Taskbar / add feature -->
    <panel>
      <gxm:add-feature-select-layer config="edit"/>
      <gxm:add-feature/>
    </panel>
</layout>
```

This layout has components such as `<search/>` or `<gxm:add-feature/>` which require the context of a specific map to function. However, these components are **not** nested within the `<map/>` component in the app. Therefore, they will start a breadth first search to discover a map model import it.

## Component Defaults

Most components support the [`config` attribute](concepts-app-config.mdx#linking-layout-to-app-config), which links a component to configuration in the `app.json`. However, many components have default values they can supply for initialization instead of relying on configuration. This means that if you omit the `config` property for certain components, the component will attempt to create itself with its default values. An example of defining default values can be seen in the `CreateDefault` method of the configuration created for [this use case](usecases-implement-component-participate-app-config.mdx#create-a-skeleton-app-config-definition). It's also the mechanism that powers the default map for this layout.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<layout xmlns="https://geocortex.com/layout/v1">
    <map id="myMap">
        <zoom padding="0.5" slot="top-left"/>
    </map>
</layout>
```
