Services act as a repository of accessible behavior and data, and can be used for a variety of purposes, from implementing commands and operations, to managing shared data, to interfacing with the REST API of an external service.

## Service Registration

All services need to be registered with Geocortex Mobile. A service is created by extending the `ServiceBase` class and registering the service class with Autofac through an assembly attribute.

<AutofacSnippet />

```cs
// highlight-next-line
[assembly: Service(typeof(CustomService), PropertiesAutowired = true)]
namespace App1.Services
{
    // highlight-next-line
    class CustomService : ServiceBase
    {
        ...
    }
}
```

## Service Lifecycle

On application load, all services that have been registered with wih Geocortex Mobile are first created and then initialized.

Services are destroyed (i.e. the `destroy` method is invoked) when the application is destroyed, e.g. when killing the application or switching applications in Geocortex Go.

## Initialization and Teardown

Services have an initialization method, which can be used to perform asynchronous startup logic, and a teardown method, which can be used to free resources when the application is destroyed

:::important
Always call `base.Dispose(disposing)` when overriding the `Dispose` method. `ServiceBase` already implements `IDisposable` and `IDisposableTracker`, so only override the `Dispose` method if you have created new managed resources which need to be cleaned up.

```cs
[assembly: Service(typeof(CustomService), PropertiesAutowired = true)]
namespace App1.Services
{
    class CustomService : ServiceBase
    {
        private bool disposed = false;

        public CustomService()
            : base()
        {
            // On creation logic here

        }
        protected override async Task DoInitialize()
        {
            // Async on initialization logic here
            return;
        }

        protected override void Dispose(bool disposing)
        {
            if (disposed)
            {
                return;
            }

            if (disposing)
            {
                // Clean up managed resources.
                // ...
            }

            // Clean up unmanaged resources.
            // ...

            // highlight-next-line
            base.Dispose(disposing);

            disposed = true;
        }


    }
}
```

## Dependency Injection

Services interact with the larger application by injecting their dependencies. Services can inject commands and operations, other services, and any other class registered with Autofac.

The following example injects the UI operations and the dialog controller into a custom service.

:::note
Services are not intended to directly interact with each other. Instead, services should [implement operations](sdk-commands-operations.mdx#implementing-commands-and-operations) which can be called by other services to indirectly interact.
:::

```cs
[assembly: Service(typeof(CustomService), PropertiesAutowired = true)]
namespace App1.Services
{
    class CustomService : ServiceBase
    {
        private UIOperations _uiOperations;
        private IDialogController _dialogController;

        public CustomService(UIOperations uiOperations, IDialogController dialogController)
            : base()
        {
            _uiOperations = uiOperations;
            _dialogController = dialogController;
        }
        ...
    }
}
```

## Configuration Models

Like components, services can be configured through the [app config](configuration-app-config-getting-started.mdx). Services can participate in the app config by creating and injecting the appropriate [**item type**](configuration-app-config-reference.mdx#app-items).

Each item type in the application is bound to a class [registered as an `AppItem` with autofac](sdk-dependency-injection.mdx#appitem). This class instantiates itself with values from the app config in it's constructor, acting as a configuration model.

A service can consume configuration by injecting the `AppItem` class as a dependency in it's constructor.
