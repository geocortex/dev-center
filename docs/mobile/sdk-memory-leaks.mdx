It is important to ensure that unmanaged resources are released when they are no longer required, in order to avoid creating memory leaks. This is accomplished using the `IDisposable` interface.
If a class creates unmanaged resources, or creates instances of classes which implement `IDisposable` themselves, it should implement `IDisposable` and release these resources in the `Dispose()` method. Detailed information on how to implement `Dispose()` can be found in [Microsoft's documentation, here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/implementing-dispose).

:::note
Classes instantiated via [dependency injection](sdk-dependency-injection.mdx) that implement `IDisposable` will automatically have `Dispose()` called by Autofac once their lifetime scope has ended, so `Dispose()` does not need to be called explicitly for such classes.

## Using Mobile's IDisposableTracker Interface

Mobile's toolkit also includes a helpful interface and extension methods to make tracking disposable resources easier: `IDisposableTracker` and `DisposableUtilities`.
`ComponentBase` and `ServiceBase` already implement `IDisposableTracker`, so any custom components or services extending these base classes can take advantage of this functionality right away.
Here is a brief example of how to use it in a new class:

```cs
public class DisposableTrackerExample: IDisposableTracker, IDisposable
{
	// Implement the IDisposableTracker interface
	public IList<IDisposable> Disposables => new List<IDisposable>();

	public DisposableTrackerExample()
	{
		// Pointer to a fictitious external unmanaged resource.
		SafeFileHandle handle = new SafeFileHandle(IntPtr.Zero, true);

		// Track the file handle in the Disposables list
		Disposables.Add(handle);
	}

	public void Dispose()
	{
		// This will dispose of the FileSafeHandle created in the constructor
		this.DisposeTrackers();
	}
}
```

Using `DisposeTrackers()` is a shortcut which is functionally identical to calling `Dispose()` on each `IDisposable` in the `Disposables` list.

`IDisposableTracker` is also used when registering commands and operations, as described [here](sdk-commands-operations.mdx#direct-registration-and-implementation), and subscribing to events, described [here](sdk-events-reference.mdx#subscribing-to-events).
