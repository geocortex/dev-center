Check out the Geocortex Workflow documentation to learn how to [make a custom form](https://docs.geocortex.com/workflow/latest/help/Default.htm#wf5/help/forms.htm). You can then link that workflow to an action in mobile using the [Geocortex Mobile Designer](https://apps.geocortex.com/mobileviewer/designer/). No custom development is required to setup up a basic custom form in Geocortex Mobile, it can all be done with out of the box tools and configuration. If you need to make custom form elements, or extend Geocortex Workflow in Geocortex Mobile with custom form activities, check out the relevant use cases.
