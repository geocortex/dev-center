It is vital that subscription handles are cleaned up when the object is cleaned up, otherwise dangling references can occur. This can be done by implementing the `IDisposable` and `IDisposableTracker` interface, and then providing `this` as the second argument to a call to subscribe. `ServiceBase` and `ComponentBase` already implement these interfaces so you don't have to.
