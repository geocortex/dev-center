If you just need to make a small change to the layout and app config of an existing application, you can [download the config and layout files for the application](https://docs.geocortex.com/mobileviewer/latest/admin-help/Default.htm#gmv/designer/configuration-Options.htm#Download-app-config%3FTocPath%3DConfiguration%7CConfiguration%2520Options%7C_____3), tweak them, and then [re-upload them](../sdk-deployment.mdx#deploying-app-config-and-layout).
