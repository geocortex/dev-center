Geocortex Mobile comes with search functionality out of the box. The default behavior will return results from all enabled layers that can be searched on the map. What if you want to replace the functionality with your own search? Or filter the results returned by the default search? [Geocortex Mobile Designer](https://apps.geocortex.com/mobileviewer/designer/) can't accomplish this, but it can be accomplished by leveraging [Geocortex Workflow](https://apps.geocortex.com/workflow/designer/) and editing the [app config](concepts-app-config.mdx).

## What you're Building

We will modify the default search behavior of the [Quickstart](quick-start.mdx) application on the Fire Hydrants layer to have an optional filter that will only show fire hydrants without a hydrants survey.

## Prerequisites

<PrereqsSnippet />

## Initial Set up

1. Run the Quickstart.
2. Turn off visibility for all Feature Layers except for "Fire Hydrants".
3. Run "Return to Default Map View" in the I Want to Menu (if you panned or zoomed the map).
4. Open the search panel and search for `active`.

You should see some number of results. If you look at the details for some of the Fire Hydrants, you'll notice some have Fire Hydrant Surveys and some don't. We will build a workflow that will only return the Fire Hydrants without a related survey when you search for `active filter:nosurveys`.

## Set up the Workflow to Run on Search

The first thing we need to do is override the default search behavior. We can do this by editing the "Search" component of the [app config](quick-start.mdx#editing-the-layout-and-app-config). The default behavior for search is a command chain that runs `tasks.search` and then `results.display`.

###### Default Search Config

```json {4}
{
    "$type": "search",
    "id": "search",
    "onSearch": ["tasks.search", "results.display"],
    "onClear": ["search.clear", "results.clear"],
    "maxResults": 50
}
```

We are going to replace the command chain with a `workflow.run` command that replicates this behavior.

1. Open up [Geocortex Workflow Designer](https://apps.geocortex.com/workflow/designer/) and create and save a new workflow.
2. Add an "Alert" activity as a test.
3. Copy the ID of the the workflow from the URL

4. Add the workflow as an app item to your [app config](quick-start.mdx#editing-the-layout-and-app-config).

```json
{
    "$schema": "..\\..\\ViewerFramework\\app-config\\mobile\\mobile-app-config.schema.json",
    "schemaVersion": "1.0",
    "items": [
        ...
        {
            "$type": "workflow",
            "id": "filterSearchWorkflow",
            "title": "Filter Search Workflow",
            "portalItem": "<your-workflow-id-here>"
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

5. Configure the `onSearch` property of the Search Component in the app config to run the workflow.

```json {4-11}
{
    "$type": "search",
    "id": "search",
    "onSearch": [
        {
            "name": "workflow.run",
            "arguments": {
                "id": "filterSearchWorkflow"
            }
        }
    ],
    "onClear": ["search.clear", "results.clear"],
    "maxResults": 50
}
```

6. Run the app and test your workflow. You should see your alert pop up when you try to search for something.

7. Open up your Workflow in the Workflow Designer again. The default behavior we just overrode can be recreated with the use of [RunCommand](https://docs.geocortex.com/workflow/latest/help/Default.htm#wf5/help/activities/run-command.htm%3FTocPath%3DActivities%7CActivity%2520Reference%7C_____169) and [RunOperation](https://docs.geocortex.com/workflow/latest/help/Default.htm#wf5/help/activities/run-operation.htm%3FTocPath%3DActivities%7CActivity%2520Reference%7C_____173) activities. `tasks.search` is an operation, so it needs a RunOperation Activity, and `results.display` is a command so it needs a RunCommand Activity. Chain these two activities together, passing the [workflow context](https://docs.geocortex.com/webviewer/latest/admin-help/Default.htm#gwv/add-a-workflow-to-an-app.htm#use-the-menu-context-as-a-workflow-input%3FTocPath%3DConfiguration%7CAdd%2520a%2520Workflow%2520to%2520an%2520App%7C_____4) to `tasks.search` and then passing the output of that operation to `results.display`.

8. Save the workflow and reload the application. Test the search functionality and ensure it works as it originally did.

## Extend the Workflow to Filter the Results.

At this point, you can choose to extend the search behavior with Geocortex Workflow in whatever way is appropriate for your use case. You could execute a different search for external results and add them to the set of results displayed, filter out specific results from the search, or replace the default search operation with an entirely different search operation. For this example, a workflow was created which checks the incoming search text for the text "filter:nosurveys" and then filters results to Fire Hydrants without a survey. The workflow [can be found here](https://latitudegeo.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=bc7647d4485743e98ea42cd69ee4aa66).

# Next Steps

This pattern of configuring behavior with a workflow can be applied to numerous components. You can use a workflow to control the behavior of the Map, Feature Details, Geolocate, Custom Components, and more. Often, a workflow can be created and used to execute custom behavior instead of requiring the implementation of a custom command or operation.
