## Component Registration

Geocortex Mobile uses
[Autofac](https://autofaccn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to register,
locate, and inject components, services and other classes.

Each component class is registered with the [`Component` assembly attribute](sdk-dependency-injection.mdx#component)
