As per [.NET and Xamarin Forms guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/xaml/xaml-basics/data-bindings-to-mvvm#a-simple-viewmodel), ViewModels usually implement the `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface to inform the view of changes to the data model. This involves a lot of boilerplate, so Geocortex Mobile has a class, `NotifyPropertyBase`, which handles the boilerplate and simplifies your code.

The ViewModel of the [progress bar custom component](tutorial-implement-component-with-ui.mdx#example-progress-bar) is a good example of this pattern.

```csharp
using App1.Components;
using Geocortex.Mobile.Composition;
using Geocortex.Mobile.Composition.Views;

[assembly: ViewModel(typeof(ProgressBarComponentViewModel))]
namespace App1.Components
{
    public class ProgressBarComponentViewModel : NotifyPropertyBase
    {
        private double _progress = 0;

        private bool _workComplete = false;

        public double Progress
        {
            get => _progress;
            set => SetProperty(ref _progress, value);
        }

        public bool WorkComplete
        {
            get => _workComplete;
            set
            {
                SetProperty(ref _workComplete, value);
                OnPropertyChanged(nameof(WorkNotComplete));
            }
        }

        public bool WorkNotComplete => !WorkComplete;
    }
}
```

`NotifyPropertyBase` implements `INotifyPropertyChanged` for you and provides a helper function, `SetProperty`. This helper function will ensure that `OnPropertyChanged` is called if the value has changed and that the underlying field is set.
