**Components** and **services** are the two basic building blocks of Geocortex Mobile. Components power the UI experience of Geocortex Mobile, and services provide the shared infrastructure and core logic that power app behavior.

## Components

In Geocortex Mobile, components are entities which implement UI/UX experiences and the associated logic. An example of a component is an I Want to Menu (IWTM). IWTMs participate in layout, implement custom behavior (display a list when clicked), and participate in app config.

Components are only **created** if they participate in the layout - if no component definition exists in the layout, none will be created. Components are **initialized** when they are activated.

## Services

In Geocortex Mobile, services are entities which provide a shared service or behavior to other components. Two key differences between components are services are...

1. Services do not participate in layout, and do not power UI (except indirectly).
1. Services are created **and** initialized on startup, before any components are created.
    - This means any service is always available to any component.

An example of a service would be a "SettingsService", which provides global settings that other components can consume.

:::note
Services are not intended to directly interact with eachother. Instead, services should [implement operations](implement-command-operation.mdx) which can be called by other services to indirectly interact.

## Creation and Initialization

This is the order of operations for component and service creation and initialization on app startup.

1. Create all services.
2. Initialize all services.
3. Create all components consumed by the layout.
4. Activate the necessary components, depending on the layout and user interaction. Components are initialized during activation.
