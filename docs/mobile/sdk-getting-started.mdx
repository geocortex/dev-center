If the built-in configurability of Geocortex Mobile does not serve your purposes, then it might be time to dive into the Geocortex Mobile SDK. Building applications on top of the Geocortex Mobile SDK requires engaging in the development, testing, and deployment of a custom application, so it's worthwhile to make sure your problem cannot be solved [with workflow or other advanced configuration](overview.mdx#explore-the-use-cases).

If you still think you need to use the Geocortex Mobile SDK, then lets get started!

## Requirements

-   Visual Studio 2019 or higher on Windows is the only officially supported development environment for the Geocortex Mobile SDK. Other development environments may be possible, but have not been verified.

### Windows

-   Windows 10 - To run the app on Windows 10, you must have Fall Creators Update installed on your Windows development PC.
    -   The SDK targets Windows 10, version 1809 (10.0; Build 17763).
    -   The minimum supported version is Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (10.0; Build 16299).

### iOS

To be able to build iOS applications, you must have a Mac; Windows cannot build iOS applications.  
Setup is required to allow Visual Studio on Windows to use the Mac to build the iOS project.

-   See: [iOS Build on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/get-started/installation/windows/)

Required software on the Mac:

-   XCode
-   Visual Studio for Mac

See the [Xamarin guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/deploy-test/) on deploying and testing iOS apps for more details.

### Android

No extra setup is required. You can install your emulator of choice, or debug on a physical device. See the [Xamarin guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/android/deploy-test/) on deploying and testing Android apps for more detail.

## Getting Up and Running

A [Geocortex Mobile Quickstart](https://github.com/geocortex/vertigis-mobile-quickstart) is provided, which is a basic Geocortex Mobile application. This Quickstart is essentially a [Xamarin Forms Quickstart Application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/get-started/Quickstarts/single-page?pivots=windows) that initializes and boots Geocortex Mobile on each platform. To get up and running, simply check out the [Mobile Quickstart Repository](https://github.com/geocortex/vertigis-mobile-quickstart) and start the solution on the appropriate platform.

:::important
Geocortex Mobile is built on [Xamarin Forms](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/), a framework for building cross platform native apps. As a consequence, building non trivial extensions to Geocortex Mobile will require some Xamarin development knowledge.

### Build and run for Windows 10

-   Set **App1.UWP** as your startup project.
-   Change the architecture from _Any CPU_ to _x86_ or _x64_.
-   Build and run.

### Build and run for Android

-   Set **App1.Android** as your startup project.
-   Choose your target device or emulator from the run dropdown in the toolbar.
    -   Please note that building and deploying to an emulator is faster than using a device.
-   Build and run.

:::note
This build can also be run from Visual Studio for Mac.
:::

### Build and run for iOS

-   Set **App1.iOS** as your startup project.
-   Ensure you are [paired with a Mac](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/get-started/installation/windows/connecting-to-mac/)
-   Choose your target device (must be plugged into Mac) or simulator from the run dropdown in the toolbar.
    -   Please note that building and deploying to a simulator is faster than using a device.
-   Build and run.

:::note
This build can also be run from Visual Studio for Mac.

## Anatomy of the Quickstart

The Quickstart is composed of four projects, one for each platform, and a common project that is shared by all platforms. This is a standard Xamarin Forms setup, as described [in their documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/get-started/Quickstarts/deepdive?pivots=windows#anatomy-of-a-xamarinforms-application). Changes have been made to each project to support the [bootstrapping of a Geocortex Mobile application](sdk-advanced-quickstart.mdx#entry-points) using the SDK.

## Next Steps

The Quickstart is a useful starting point for your custom Geocortex Mobile application. Learn the basics of the Geocortex Mobile SDK by editing the layout and app config of the Quickstart.
