**Events** are distinct, discrete messaging about a change or update that occurs in the viewer. They can be published or subscribed to by any [component, service](configuration-components-services.mdx) or [view](tutorial-implement-component-with-ui.mdx#use-xaml-to-define-your-ui) registered with Mobile, and can be used to initiate behaviors, communicate data changes, and more. Events themselves do not execute behavior, but merely provide messaging so subscribers can act on changes.

Events are internal to Geocortex Mobile, so they can only be consumed by custom code. Custom components and services can access events through [dependency injection](sdk-dependency-injection).

The full list of existing events available in Geocortex Mobile can be [found in the API documentation](api-commands-operations-events.mdx#events).

Events in Geocortex Mobile are grouped by categories, such as `app` or `geolocation`.

```
app.activated
app.backgrounded
geolocation.position-changed
geolocation.position-lost
```

Events can publish custom arguments with information about the change they are communicating.
