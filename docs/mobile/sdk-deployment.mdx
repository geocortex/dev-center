If you only need to modify the app config and layout of a Geocortex Mobile application, you can use the [Geocortex Mobile Designer](https://apps.geocortex.com/mobileviewer/designer/) interface. However, if you need to write custom code, you will need to deploy and manage a fully custom application.

### Deploying App Config and Layout

Geocortex Mobile Designer provides a powerful interface for editing the layout and configuration of built-in components, but if you need finer grain control over the app config and layout, you will need to upload your custom layout and app JSON.

1. Type `Ctrl + Shift + E` while focused in the Geocortex Mobile Designer to open up the experimental development editing interface.
1. Copy and paste the `app.json` and `layout-*.xml` files from your local SDK project into to the Geocortex Mobile Designer Interface.

:::note
The layout files in the Geocortex Mobile Application may have different names than your local layout files, so you may need to update the `url` to the layout file in your app config to match.
:::

```json
{
  "items": [
    ...
    {
      "id":"desktop-landscape",
      "title":"Desktop Landscape",
      "url":"./desktop-landscape.xml",
      "$type":"layout"
    }
    ...
  ]
}
```

### Fully Custom Application with Custom Code

The Quickstart provided is a standard Xamarin forms application, and can be deployed in accordance to [Xamarin's guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/deploy-test/).
