## Applications

The core element of the Geocortex Mobile Framework is an **Application**. Applications are composed of three main pieces:

#### 1. Layout XML that represents the visual layout of the application.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<layout xmlns="https://geocortex.com/layout/v1">
    <map id="map-primary" config="default" />
</layout>
```

An **layout** is composed of **components**, which are the conceptual building blocks of an application. Components can define their own UI, consume configuration, and can be nested and interact with other components.

Every components can have an `id` and `config` attribute; these two attributes are key to linking the layout to the **app config**.

#### 2. App Config JSON for the application.

```json title="app.json"
{
    "schemaVersion": "1.0",
    "items": [
        {
            "$type": "map-extension",
            "id": "default",
            "webMap": "7e5d9cf959e149af95bb01be8b62c107"
        }
    ]
}
```

An app config file is composed of high level configuration and a list of **app items**. App items can correspond to components in the layout, portal items, or any [other defined item type](concepts-advanced-config.mdx#custom-app-items).

#### 3. The Geocortex Mobile code which renders the layout and powers functionality.

The Geocortex Mobile Framework consumes layout and app config to create fully functional mobile-ready mapping applications. You can use this framework out of the box, or extend it using the Geocortex Mobile SDK.

<br />

These three pieces are the building blocks of an application, with the `layout.xml` and `app.config` files being the driving forces that control how an application looks, how it responds to user interaction, and what data it consumes. Extensive customization can be done simply by modifying these two files, without requiring any custom code.
