## Autocomplete Properties

The two properties `$schema` and `schemaVersion` are almost always present in an `app.json` file. They power the Visual Studio autocomplete linting and intellisense in the `app.json` file for the various properties that each **app item** has. The `app.json` included with the [Quickstart](sdk-getting-started.mdx) references a schema at the root of the project. If you move an `app.json` file, you will need to fix the relative path to the schema file. For more information on json schemas, see [json-schema.org](https://json-schema.org/).

:::note
The `ViewerFramework` folder containing the schema will not be created until an initial build is complete.
:::

```json
{
  "$schema": "..\\..\\ViewerFramework\\app-config\\mobile\\mobile-app-config.schema.json",

  "schemaVersion": "1.0",

  "items": [...]
}
```

## App Items

<AppItemSnippet />

### Custom App Items

App items in Geocortex Mobile correspond to a class that extends `VisualAppItem` and registers with **Autofac** as an `AppItem` type.

<AutofacSnippet />

```csharp
[assembly: AppItem(CustomComponentConfiguration.ConfigItemtype, typeof(CustomComponentConfiguration))]
namespace App1.Configuration
{
    public class CustomComponentConfiguration : VisualAppItem
    {
        public const string ConfigItemtype = "custom-component-config";

        ... // config properties, etc

    }
}
```

Registering a class in this manner makes mobile aware of a new **app item type**, which can be added to the items list in the `app.json` with the appropiate `$type` specified. Components can consume these app items, and by extension, the configuration. Check out [components with app config](usecases-implement-component-participate-app-config.mdx#create-a-skeleton-app-config-definition) for more details.

## Item URIs and Resource URIs

**Item URI's** are a commonly used pattern in the `app.json` to uniquely identify and reference app items. They take the format

`item://<item-type>/<item-id>`

For example, the item URI for the following item is `item://menu-item/measureAction`

```json
{
  "$type": "menu",
  "id": "feature-actions",
  "items": [...]
}
```

These item URI's can be used by app items to include other app items as property values, allowing reuse.

```json
{
    "$type": "feature-details",
    "id": "feature-details",
    "featureActions": "item://menu/feature-actions"
}
```

**Resource URI's** are used to load layouts in Geocortex Mobile. Layout files are [added to Geocortex Mobile](usecases-add-medium-layout.mdx) as an asset which is copied into the end users local data folder. These copied assets are referenced with a URI of the format

`resource://layout-<size>.xml`

For example, here's references to a small, medium, and large layout in the `app.json`

```json
({
    "$type": "layout",
    "id": "desktop-layout",
    "url": "resource://layout-large.xml",
    "tags": ["mobile", "large"]
},
{
    "$type": "layout",
    "id": "tablet-layout",
    "url": "resource://layout-medium.xml",
    "tags": ["mobile", "medium"]
},
{
    "$type": "layout",
    "id": "handheld-layout",
    "url": "resource://layout-small.xml",
    "tags": ["mobile", "small"]
})
```
