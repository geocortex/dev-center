If the built-in configurability of Geocortex Mobile does not serve your purposes, then it might be time to dive into the Geocortex Mobile SDK. Building applications on top of the Geocortex Mobile SDK requires engaging in the development, testing, and deployment of custom code, so it's worthwhile to make sure your problem cannot be solved [with workflow or other advanced configuration](overview.mdx#explore-the-use-cases).

If you still think you need to use the Geocortex Mobile SDK, then let's get started!

## Creation and Initialization

This is the order of operations for component and service creation and initialization on app startup.

1. Create all services.
2. Initialize all services.
3. Create all components consumed by the layout.
4. Activate the necessary components, depending on the layout and user interaction. Components will be initialized shortly after they are activated.
