As per [.NET and Xamarin Forms guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/xaml/xaml-basics/data-bindings-to-mvvm#a-simple-viewmodel), ViewModels usually implement the `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface to inform the view of changes to the data model. This involves a lot of boilerplate, so Geocortex Mobile has a class, `NotifyPropertyBase`, which handles the boilerplate and simplifies your code.

The ViewModel of the [Doomsday Cookie Clicker](implement-component-with-ui.mdx#example-doomsday-cookie-clicker) is a good example of this pattern.

<DoomsdayCookieClickerViewModel />

`NotifyPropertyBase` implements `INotifyPropertyChanged` for you and provides a helper function, `SetProperty`. This helper function will ensure that `OnPropertyChanged` is called if the value has changed and that the underlying field is set.
