Events can be published, subscribed, or created by an custom service, component model, or component.

## Publishing Events

Events can be published by calling the `.publish` method on the event object.

In both components and services, event objects are access by injecting the event reference class.

:::tip
The `AllEvents` class is a repository of all available events in the Geocortex Mobile SDK
:::

```cs
class CustomServiceOrComponent : ServiceBase
{
    private AllEvents _events;

    private TaskEvents _taskEvents;

    public CustomServiceOrComponent(AllEvents events, TaskEvents taskEvents)
        : base()
    {
        _events = events;
        _taskEvents = taskEvents;
    }

    public void PublishSomeEvent()
    {
        _taskEvents.Identified.Publish(someFeatures);
        // _events.TaskEvents.Identified.Publish(someFeatures);
    }
}
```

## Subscribing to Events

Events can be subscribed to by calling the `.subscribe` method on the event object.

In both components and services, event objects are access by injecting the event reference class.

<CleanupHandlesSnippet />

```cs
public class CustomServiceOrComponent : ServiceBase
{
    public CustomServiceOrComponent(UIEvents uiEvents)
    {
        // highlight-next-line
        uiEvents.ComponentActivated.Subscribe(_onComponentActivated, this);
    }

    private void _onComponentActivated(string id)
    {
        // ... do something on component activation
    }
}
```

## Creating Custom Events

Custom events in Geocortex Mobile are created through the `IEventRegistry`. Events can be directly created in any component or service that can inject this class, but it is best practice to define events in a class that extends `EventsBase` and registers with Autofac. This allows your events to be injected and referenced by any component or service across the app.

```cs
// highlight-next-line
[assembly: Export(typeof(CustomEvents), SingleInstance = true, AsImplementedInterfaces = false, AsSelf = true, PropertiesAutowired = true)]
namespace App1.Events
{
    public class CustomEvents : EventsBase
    {
        // highlight-next-line
        public IEvent SomeEvent => GetEvent("custom.some-event");

        public CustomEvents(IEventRegistry eventRegistry)
            : base(eventRegistry)
        {
        }
    }
}
```

### Event Arguments

Events optionally take a type argument, which represents the object associated with the event consumed by the subscriber. This can be a simple or complex object.

```cs
public class CustomEvents : EventsBase
{
    // highlight-start
    public IEvent EventWithNoArg => GetEvent("custom.no-arg");

    public IEvent<string> EventWithSimpleArg => GetEvent<string>("custom.simple-arg");

    public IEvent<YourCustomType> EventWithComplexArg => GetEvent("custom.complex-arg");
    // highlight-end

    public CustomEvents(IEventRegistry eventRegistry)
        : base(eventRegistry)
    {
    }
}
```
