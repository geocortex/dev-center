:::tip
Geocortex Mobile has many built in [Commands and Operations](concepts-commands-operations.mdx) which can be chained together to build custom behaviors. If these Commands and Operations are not enough to accomplish your goal, you can use [Geocortex Workflow](usecases-change-default-search-behavior.mdx) to take custom behavior even further without writing custom code. If Workflow is still not enough to accomplish your needs, then it might be time to implement a Custom Command / Operation.
:::

This article will walk you through implementing a custom command in Geocortex Mobile that displays an alert.

## Prerequisites

<PrereqsSnippet />

## Create the Backing Service

It's convention that command and operations in Geocortex Mobile are registered and implemented by a [service or component](concepts-components-services.mdx), so the first thing we will do is create a service.

1. Create a new file `Services/AlertService.cs` under the platform agnostic project.
2. In the file, add a new service class `AlertService` and register it with **Autofac**.

<AutofacSnippet />

```csharp
using App1.Services.AlertService;
using Geocortex.Mobile.Composition;
using Geocortex.Mobile.Composition.Services;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

[assembly: Service(typeof(Service), PropertiesAutowired = true)]
namespace App1.Services.AlertService
{
    class AlertService : ServiceBase
    {
    }
}
```

:::info
The two key components of this snippet are the `[assembly: Service(...)]` tag and the class extension `AlertService: ServiceBase`. These two pieces register the service with Autofac and Geocortex Mobile and cause it to be initialized on startup.
:::

3. Create a class `Services/AlertOperations` under the platform agnostic project.
4. In the file, add a new class `AlertOperations` and register it with Autofac.

```csharp
using App1.Services.AlertOperations;
using Geocortex.Mobile.Composition;
using Geocortex.Mobile.Composition.Messaging;
using Geocortex.Mobile.Infrastructure.Messaging;

[assembly: Export(typeof(AlertOperations), SingleInstance = true)]
namespace App1.Services.AlertOperations
{
    class AlertOperations : OperationsBase
    {
        public AlertOperations(IOperationRegistry operationRegistry)
            : base(operationRegistry)
        {
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementing the Operation

Creating a new Operation in mobile consists of two pieces:

-   Defining the Operation's name, inputs, and outputs
-   Registering an "Execution" function for the operation
    -   This function will be the actual code that executes when the operation is called.

### Define the Operation

An Operation is defined in the class that extends `OperationsBase`. In our example, it's `AlertOperations`.

-   An `IVoidOperation` produces no output, and optionally takes an input.

```csharp
public IVoidOperation NoInputNoOutput => GetVoidOperation("fire.phasers");
public IVoidOperation<Temperature> SomeInputNoOutput => GetVoidOperation<Temperature>("tea.earl-grey");
```

-   An `IOperation` produces an output, and optionally takes an input.

```csharp
public IOperation<Mischief> NoInputSomeOutput => GetOperation<Mischief>("q.appear");
public IOperation<Deuterium, WarpSpeed> SomeInputSomeOutput => GetOperation<Deuterium, WarpSpeed>("warpdrive.engage");
```

:::note
Operation names in Geocortex Mobile generally take the format `<category>.<name>`, with multiple words `kebab-cased`.
:::

For this example, let's define a operation with some input and no output.

```csharp
class AlertOperations : OperationsBase
{
    public IVoidOperation<string> DisplayCustomAlert => GetVoidOperation<string>("custom-alert.display");

    public AlertOperations(IOperationRegistry operationRegistry)
        : base(operationRegistry)
    {
    }
}
```

### Register an Implementation for the Operation

Next, we need to register an implementation for our operation in the `AlertService`.

1. Add a public constructor that takes an `AlertOperations` to the Service.

```csharp
    [assembly: Service(typeof(Service), PropertiesAutowired = true)]
    class AlertService : ServiceBase
    {
        // highlight-next-line
        public AlertService(AlertOperations alertOperations)
        {
        }
    }
```

:::note
We never have to explicity pass this property because Autofac will automatically inject it.
:::

2. Create an implementation for displaying a custom alert and register it as an execution for the operation.

```csharp
[assembly: Service(typeof(AlertService))]
namespace App1.Services
{
    class AlertService : ServiceBase
    {
        public AlertService(AlertOperations alertOperations)
        {
            // highlight-start
            alertOperations.DisplayCustomAlert.RegisterExecute(
                (args) =>
                {
                    Application.Current.MainPage.DisplayAlert("Custom Alert", args, "OK");
                    return Task.FromResult((object)null);
                }, this);
            // highlight-end
        }
    }
}
```

:::note
Multiple implementations can be registered for an Command or Operation.
:::

Congratulations! You just created your first custom operation. You can easily test your new operation by setting it to [run it on map initialization](usecases-change-default-behavior.mdx).

```json
{
    "$schema": "..\\..\\ViewerFramework\\app-config\\mobile\\mobile-app-config.schema.json",
    "schemaVersion": "1.0",
    "items": [
        ...
        {
            "$type": "map-extension",
            "id": "map1",
            "onClick": [ "tasks.identify", "highlights.pulse", "results.display" ],
            "onInitialized": [
                {
                    "name": "custom-alert.display",
                    "arguments": "This is a custom operation!"
                }
            ]
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

## Register Implementation Without an Operations Class

Althought it is best practice to define an operations class that extends `OperationsBase`, you can register a command or operation from anywhere you can inject the `IOperationRegistry`. For example, this service registers an new operation `custom.alert` without defining an `OperationsBase` class.

:::tip
This pattern can be useful for registering dynamically generated commands or implementations.
:::

```csharp
using App1.Services;
using Geocortex.Mobile.Composition;
using Geocortex.Mobile.Composition.Messaging;
using Geocortex.Mobile.Composition.Services;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

[assembly: Service(typeof(CustomService))]
namespace App1.Services
{
    public class CustomService : ServiceBase
    {
        public CustomService(IOperationRegistry operationRegistry)
            : base()
        {
            // highlight-start
            operationRegistry.VoidOperation<string>("custom.alert").RegisterExecute((string customMessage) =>
            {
                return Xamarin.Forms.Application.Current.MainPage.DisplayAlert("Custom Alert", customMessage, "Cancel");
            }, this);
            // highlight-end

        }
    }
}
```

## Relevant SDK Samples

## Next Steps

Commands and operations are the logical building blocks of executing custom behavior in Geocortex Mobile, but sometimes you need to take things a bit further. Creating custom components can allow you to design completely custom UI for Geocortex Mobile, and creating background services can enable the execution of tasks on an arbitrary schedule.
