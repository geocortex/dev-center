Components and services have multiple ways of interacting with other components and services.

-   When possible, interaction through [commands and operations](sdk-commands-operations.mdx#running-commands-and-operations) should be preferred, as this introduces the loosest coupling.
-   When you need stronger coupling and direct access to a service, then [dependency injection](sdk-dependency-injection.mdx) can be used to reference services.

If a component or service needs access to the [ArcGIS MapView object](https://developers.arcgis.com/net/latest/uwp/api-reference/html/T_Esri_ArcGISRuntime_Xamarin_Forms_MapView.htm) powering the applications map, it can reference it through an `ILayoutModel`.

## Interacting with the `MapView`

Components or services can interact with the `MapView` by injecting an `ILayoutModel` that takes a `MapView`. The actual `MapView` needs to be resolved once the map component has loaded, so it's best practice to resolve the `ILayoutModel` in the initialization method of the component or service.

:::note
A layout model is resolved according to the [layout hierarchy](configuration-advanced-model-binding.mdx).
:::

```cs
class CustomComponent : ComponentBase
{
    private readonly ILayoutModel<MapView> _mapViewResolver;

    private MapView _mapView;

    // highlight-next-line
    public CustomComponent(ILayoutModel<MapView> mapViewResolver)
    {
        _mapViewResolver = mapViewResolver;
    }

    protected async override Task DoInitializeAsync()
    {
        // highlight-next-line
        _mapView = await _mapViewResolver.ResolveAsync();

        var wkid = _mapView.SpatialReference.Wkid;

        ...
    }
    ...
}
```
