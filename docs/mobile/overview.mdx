[Geocortex Mobile](https://www.geocortex.com/products/gxm/) is a framework for configuring and building mobile offline-capable custom apps on Esri's platform. Geocortex Mobile is part of the [Geocortex suite of products](https://www.geocortex.com/products/).

You can use the Geocortex Mobile framework to build mobile, offline-capable apps that can run on Android, iOS, or Windows platforms. Geocortex Mobile apps make it possible to pan and zoom the map, search for features, review attributes, add and edit features, add attachments, and track your movements in real time. Integration with [Geocortex Workflow](../workflow/overview.mdx) ensures that you can build apps for many business processes. Geocortex Mobile apps can be used in the field to collect data, including photos and documents that can be attached to the map, perform inspections, or add and edit ArcGIS features.

Geocortex Mobile was designed to be highly configurable out of the box. Geocortex Mobile consists of the Geocortex Mobile Viewer which provides the runtime for mobile applications, and the [Geocortex Mobile Designer](https://apps.geocortex.com/mobileviewer/designer/), which provides a powerful interface to configure and deploy Geocortex Mobile Applications.

## Start with the Concepts

The core element of Geocortex Mobile is an **Application**. Applications are composed of three main pieces:

1. [**Layout XML**](concepts-layout.mdx) that represents the visual layout of the application.

2. [**App Config JSON**](concepts-app-config.mdx) that configures the application.

3. The Geocortex Mobile code which renders the layout and powers functionality.

:::tip
[Explore the concepts](concepts-key-concepts.mdx) to learn more about how you can use the [layout](concepts-layout.mdx) and [app config](concepts-app-config.mdx) to create custom behavior and appearance. You can also learn about the [components and services](concepts-components-services.mdx) that are key to extending Geocortex Mobile with custom code.

## Explore the Use Cases

Explore how the app config and layout can be used to change the look and feel as well as modify and extend the built-in behavior of a Geocortex Mobile Application.

## Take your Application Further with the SDK

Use the [Geocortex Mobile SDK](sdk-getting-started.mdx) and [Geocortex Workflow SDK](../workflow/sdk-overview.mdx) to build completely custom UI and behavior.
