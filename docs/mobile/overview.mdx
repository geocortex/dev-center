[Geocortex Mobile](https://www.geocortex.com/products/gxm/) is a framework for configuring and building mobile offline-capable custom apps on Esri's platform. Geocortex Mobile is part of the [Geocortex suite of products](https://www.geocortex.com/products/).

You can use the Geocortex Mobile framework to build mobile, offline-capable apps that can run on Android, iOS, or Windows platforms. Geocortex Mobile apps make it possible to pan and zoom the map, search for features, review attributes, add and edit features, add attachments, and track your movements in real time. Integration with [Geocortex Workflow](../workflow/overview.mdx) ensures that you can build apps for many business processes. Geocortex Mobile apps can be used in the field to collect data, including photos and documents that can be attached to the map, perform inspections, or add and edit ArcGIS features.

Geocortex Mobile was designed to be highly configurable out of the box. Geocortex Mobile consists of the Geocortex Mobile Viewer which provides the runtime for mobile applications, and the [Geocortex Mobile Designer](https://apps.geocortex.com/mobileviewer/designer/), which provides a powerful interface to configure and deploy Geocortex Mobile Applications.

## Extending Geocortex Mobile

If the Geocortex Mobile Designer cannot accomplish what you need, you can manually configure and extend Geocortex Mobile in a number of ways.

The simplest way to customize your application is through configuration. If you need to implement complex behavior and user interactions, Geocortex Workflow may be able to accomplish your goals through an easy to use interface. Geocortex Workflow can be taken even further through custom extensions to its activity and form element library. Geocortex Mobile can also be extended through its SDK to create completely custom experiences.

### Application Configuration

Every Geocortex Mobile application has a [**layout**](configuration-layout-getting-started.mdx), which represents the visual layout of the application, and [**app config**](configuration-app-config-getting-started.mdx) that configures various behaviors and settings within the application. Layout and app config can be easily edited to customize the appearance and behavior of an an Geocortex Mobile application without writing custom code.

Before investing in developing workflows or custom code, see if your use case can be solved through the use of layout and configuration. [Explore the concepts](key-concepts.mdx) to learn more about layout and app config.

### Geocortex Workflow

[**Geocortex Workflow**](https://docs.geocortex.com/workflow/) is a powerful tool that comes bundled with Geocortex Mobile which can create custom behavior and UI without custom code development. Many behaviors in Geocortex Mobile can be [replaced by a workflow](tutorial-change-default-map-click-behavior.mdx) that runs entirely custom logic. Geocortex Workflow can even [display complex customized forms](https://docs.geocortex.com/workflow/latest/help/Default.htm#wf5/help/forms.htm).

### Custom Workflow Activities and Form Elements

If Geocortex Workflow meets most of your need, but is missing a few crucial elements, the best solution may be to extend Geocortex Workflow with **[custom activities](tutorial-implement-custom-activity.mdx)** and **[form elements](tutorial-implement-custom-form-elements.mdx)**. Extending Geocortex Workflow can take the rich out of the box Workflow experience and augment it with business logic or UI specific to your use case.

### Custom Components and Services

If you need to build entirely custom and new behavior and UI, you should check out the [**Geocortex Mobile SDK**](sdk-overview.mdx). Using the Geocortex Mobile SDK, you can develop custom behavior by creating new [commands and operations](tutorial-implement-command-operation.mdx) which can be [used in the app config](configuration-commands-operations.mdx). If you need to create a new UI element, you can build [custom components](sdk-components-create.mdx). With the ability to create [background services](tutorial-implement-service-fetch-dynamic-data.mdx), facilitate [component and service interactions](sdk-component-service-interactions.mdx), and [participate in the app config](tutorial-implement-component-participate-app-config.mdx), the possibilities for extending Geocortex Mobile are endless.
