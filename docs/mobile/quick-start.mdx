If the built in configurability of Geocortex Mobile does not serve your purposes, then it might be time to dive into the Geocortex Mobile SDK. Building applications on top of the Geocortex Mobile SDK requires engaging in the development, testing, and deployment of a custom application, so it's worthwhile to make sure your problem cannot be solved [with workflow or other advanced configuration](overview.mdx#start-with-your-use-case).

If you still think you need to use the Geocortex Mobile SDK, then lets get started!

## Requirements

-   Visual Studio 2019 or higher on Windows is the only officially supported development environment for the Geocortex Mobile SDK. Other development environments may be possible, but have not been verified.

### Windows

-   Windows 10 - To run the app on Windows 10, you must have Fall Creators Update installed on your Windows development PC.
    -   The SDK targets Windows 10, version 1809 (10.0; Build 17763).
    -   The minimum supported version is Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (10.0; Build 16299).

### IOS

To be able to build iOS applications, you must have a Mac; Windows cannot build iOS applications.  
Setup is required to allow Visual Studio on Windows to use the Mac to build the iOS project.

-   See: [iOS Build on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/get-started/installation/windows/)

Required software on the Mac:

-   XCode
-   Visual Studio for Mac

See the [Xamarin guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/deploy-test/) on deploying and testing IOS apps for more details.

### Android

No extra setup is required. You can install your emulator of choice, or debug on a physical device. See the [Xamarin guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/android/deploy-test/) on deploying and testing Android apps for more detail.

## Getting Up and Running

A [Geocortex Mobile Quickstart](https://github.com/geocortex/vertigis-mobile-quickstart) is provided, which is a basic Geocortex Mobile application. This quickstart is essentially a [Xamarin Forms Quickstart Application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/get-started/quickstarts/single-page?pivots=windows) that initializes and boots Geocortex Mobile on each platform. To get up and running, simply check out the [Mobile Quickstart Repository](https://github.com/geocortex/vertigis-mobile-quickstart) and start the solution on the appropriate platform.

:::important
Geocortex Mobile is built on [Xamarin Forms](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/), a framework for building cross platform native apps. As a consequence, building non trivial extensions to Geocortex Mobile will require some Xamarin development knowledge.

### Build and run for Windows 10

-   Set **App1.UWP** as your startup project.
-   Change the architecture from _Any CPU_ to _x86_ or _x64_.
-   Build and run.

### Build and run for Android

-   Set **App1.Android** as your startup project.
-   Choose your target device or emulator from the run dropdown in the toolbar.
    -   Please note that building and deploying to an emulator is faster than using a device.
-   Build and run.

### Build and run for iOS

-   Set **App1.iOS** as your startup project.
-   Ensure you are [paired with a Mac](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/get-started/installation/windows/connecting-to-mac/)
-   Choose your target device (must be plugged into Mac) or simulator from the run dropdown in the toolbar.
    -   Please note that building and deploying to a simulator is faster than using a device.
-   Build and run.

## Anatomy of the Quickstart

The quickstart is composed of four projects, one for each platform, and a common project that is shared by all platforms. This is a standard Xamarin Forms setup, as described [in their documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/get-started/quickstarts/deepdive?pivots=windows#anatomy-of-a-xamarinforms-application). Changes have been made to each project to support the bootstrapping of a Geocortex Mobile application using the SDK.

### Geocortex Mobile SDK Packages

The Geocortex Mobile SDK is composed of Geocortex packages:

-   `Geocortex Icons`
    -   This package provides configurable vector icons for use in Geocortex Mobile apps.
-   `Geocortex Mobile`
    -   This package is the heart of the Mobile SDK, and powers the interface and interactions of a Mobile Xamarin Application.
    -   This package includes the Geocortex.API namespace, an API for working with foundational Geocortex models, configuration, Esri's ArcGIS types, etc.
-   `Geocortex Workflow`
    -   Geocortex Mobile heavily relies on [Geocortex Workflow](../workflow/overview.mdx) to power its functionality.
    -   Geocortex Workflow is itself composed of many packages (Image Activities, Forms, GIS, Runtime).
-   `Geocortex Viewer Framework`
    -   This package provides the definitions of [layout](concepts-layout.mdx) and [app config](concepts-app-config.mdx) that are central to every Mobile app.

### Entry Points

Each platform has platform specific setup and an entry point, after which they all bootstrap the application through the platform agnostic project. In the platform agnostic project, the `OnStart` method of `App.cs` calls the Geocortex Mobile SDK Bootstrapper, and loads and displays the application with the given `app.json` configuration.

#### Android

The `OnCreate` method of the `MainActivity.cs` file in the Android specific project handles Android specific setup.

#### IOS

The `FinishedLaunching` method of the `AppDelegate.cs` in the IOS specific project handles IOS specific setup.

#### Universal Windows

The constructors of the `App.xaml.cs` and `MainPage.xaml.cs` files in the UWP specific project handles Windows specific setup.

## Error Handling

In each of the platform specific setups, there is a call to the `HandleExceptions` method. This method tells Geocortex Mobile to handle exceptions and display an Error. If you need to have control over global error handling, you can remove the call to `HandleExceptions` and implement your own global exception handling for the Xamarin Application. [This Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39503390/global-exception-handling-in-xamarin-cross-platform) is a good starting point for implementating global error handling.

## Editing the Layout and App Config

Many changes to Geocortex Mobile will require editing the layout and app config for your custom application. The app config and layout files are contained in the shared platform agnostic project. Each platform specific project links to these files as an asset or a reference, so editing the files in the platform agnostic project will change them for all platforms. Check out [layout](concepts-layout.mdx) and [app config](concepts-app-config.mdx) to learn more about configuring Geocortex Mobile with these files.

## Referencing Third Party Libraries

The [Geocortex Mobile quickstart](../mobile/quick-start.mdx) is simply a [.NET Xamarin Forms project](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/get-started/quickstarts/deepdive?pivots=windows) so you can add dependencies to it like any other .NET project.

:::caution
However, the Geocortex Mobile SDK relies on exact versions of [ArcGIS Runtime](https://developers.arcgis.com/arcgis-runtime/) and [Xamarin Forms](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin/xamarin-forms) NuGet packages.
:::

## Development Patterns

For the most part, the Geocortex Mobile project follows the development practices outlined in [Enterprise Application Patterns using Xamarin.Forms](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/enterprise-application-patterns/).

One major deviation from usual Xamarin Development patterns is that [Autofac](https://autofac.org/) is used as the Dependency Injection framework.

## Deployment

The quickstart provided is a standard Xamarin forms application, and can be deployed in accordance to [Xamarin's guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/deploy-test/).

## Next Steps

The quickstart is a useful starting point for your custom Geocortex Mobile application. Build on top of it by following along with a [use case](implement-command-operation.mdx), or check out the [SDK Samples](https://github.com/geocortex/vertigis-mobile-samples) for inspiration and examples of what you can accomplish with the Geocortex Mobile SDK.
