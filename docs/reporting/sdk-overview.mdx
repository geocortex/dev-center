The Geocortex Reporting REST API is responsible for generating all reports. In Geocortex viewer applications there are built-in features that handle the communication with the REST API. If you want to leverage Geocortex Reporting from another application you will need to handle the communication with the REST API yourself. You can interact directly with the REST API by issuing your own HTTP requests, or you can use a pre-built library that provides an easier to use interface that hides all the HTTP request details. The latter is much simpler and more reliable.
