title: Run a report from an ArcGIS Notebook
description: VertiGIS Studio Reporting - ArcGIS Notebook
---

You can use the **VertiGIS Studio Reporting Client for Python** package to run reports from ArcGIS Notebooks.

## Prerequisites

-   ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise 10.7+
-   An ArcGIS user with permission to create and edit ArcGIS Notebooks
-   An existing VertiGIS Studio Report that accepts a `FeatureIds` parameter

## Author the Notebook

1. Sign into ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Enterprise as a Notebook Author user
2. Create a new Notebook
3. Add a cell with the following script:

```py
!pip install geocortex-reporting-client
```

4. Run the cell to install the `geocortex-reporting-client` package
5. Add a cell with the following script:

```py
from geocortex.reporting.client import run

report = await run("itemid", FeatureIds=[1, 2, 3])
print(report)
```

6. Replace `itemid` with the ArcGIS item ID of your report
7. Update the array `[1, 2, 3]` to contain the feature IDs of the features you want to generate the report for
8. Run the cell to generate the report

## ArcGIS Enterprise Support

The same process applies to ArcGIS Enterprise 10.7+ but you must also supply the `portal_url` argument to the `run` method

```py
report = await run(
    "itemid",
    portal_url="https://myportal.server.com/portal",
    FeatureIds=[1, 2, 3]
)
```
