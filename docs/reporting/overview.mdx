[Geocortex Reporting](https://www.geocortex.com/products/geocortex-reporting/) is a flexible tool for creating sophisticated, professional-looking reports that include spatial and non-spatial data from ArcGIS map services, tables, databases, and other data sources. Reports can be created in all shapes and sizes, with varying complexities and requirements, from basic mailing label reports to inspection compliance reports for governing bodies like FEMA. Geocortex Reporting is part of the [Geocortex suite of products](https://www.geocortex.com/products/).

Reports can be shared with end users allowing them to create on-demand, print-ready PDF reports about maps and features, using data from the user's current session. Reports can be run in [Geocortex Web](https://www.geocortex.com/products/gxw/), [Geocortex Viewer for HTML5](https://docs.geocortex.com/essentials/gvh/), [Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/web-appbuilder/overview), or directly through our convenient [REST API](https://apps.geocortex.com/reporting/service/api-viewer/index.html?url=../swagger.json).
