:::warning
The Geocortex Web SDK is currently in preview. The patterns for development and deployment are still under active development and are subject to change. Deploying your custom code into production is not recommended until the SDK is finalized.
:::

If the built-in configurability of Geocortex Web does not serve your purposes, then it might be time to dive into the Geocortex Web SDK. Building applications on top of the Geocortex Web SDK requires engaging in the development, testing, and deployment of custom code, so it's worthwhile to make sure your problem cannot be solved [with workflow or other advanced configuration](overview.mdx#explore-the-use-cases).

If you still think you need to use the Geocortex Web SDK, then let's get started!

<DesignerCallout />

## Overview

The Geocortex SDK provides a development toolkit for building custom [components](usecases-implement-component-with-ui.mdx), [services](usecases-implement-service.mdx), and more into a package that can be deployed to Geocortex Web called a _library_. Once the _library_ has been developed, it can then be [deployed](sdk-deployment.mdx) to your SaaS or on-premises environment.

## Requirements

-   The latest LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    -   You can run `node -v` in your terminal to check the version you have installed
-   A code editor of your choice. We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Getting Started

1. Run `npx @vertigis/web-sdk@beta create <library-name>` where `<library-name>` is the name of the directory that will be created in the current working directory
    - For example: `npx @vertigis/web-sdk@beta create test-lib`
1. Open the `library-name` directory in your favorite IDE. We recommend using Visual Studio Code for the best experience.
1. Run `npm start` to start the development server

The running development server automatically detects changes to your source files. You can simply edit the layout, config, or custom code and the development server will automatically refresh the application with the latest changes.

## Project Structure

The created project contains a few important directories:

1. The `src` directory, which contains your custom library code. We've included a sample component to get you started
1. The `app` directory, which contains a minimal development application [layout and app config](concepts-key-concepts.mdx) to be used for testing your custom code before deployment to production

## Development Patterns

If you are developing custom code that is mostly independent of app context, we suggest that you use the minimal layout and app config with only the required components.

If you need to develop custom code that requires the context of a custom application built in Geocortex Web Designer, take the following steps to import your SaaS or on premise application into your local Web SDK environment.

1. Open your application in Geocortex Web Designer.
1. [Download the application configuration](https://docs.geocortex.com/webviewer/latest/admin-help/Default.htm#gwv/download-app-configuration.htm).
1. Delete the contents of the `app` directory.
1. Extract the contents to you in your Web SDK Applications `app` directory, overwriting existing app config and layout.
1. Develop your custom code on top of your existing application.

:::important
You may need to rename the downloaded layout file to `layout.xml`.
