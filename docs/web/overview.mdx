[Geocortex Web](https://www.geocortex.com/products/gxw/) is a next-generation framework for creating sleek and effective GIS applications for a wide variety of browsers. Apps allow users to view and interact with web-based maps and associated data. Geocortex Web can seamlessly display both 2D and 3D map data. Integration with [Geocortex Workflow](../workflow/overview.mdx) ensures that you can build apps for many business processes. Geocortex Web is part of the [Geocortex suite of products](https://www.geocortex.com/products/).

Geocortex Web apps are created, configured and deployed with [Geocortex Web Designer](https://apps.geocortex.com/webviewer/designer/). Web Designer is an intuitive web application that displays a live preview of Geocortex Web apps as they are being configured.

## Start with the Concepts

The core element of Geocortex Web is an **Application**. Applications are composed of three main pieces:

1. [**Layout XML**](configuration-layout-getting-started.mdx) that represents the visual layout of the application.

2. [**App Config JSON**](configuration-app-config-getting-started.mdx) that configures the application.

3. The Geocortex Web code which renders the layout and powers functionality.

:::tip
[Explore the concepts](key-concepts.mdx) to learn more about how you can use the [layout](configuration-layout-getting-started.mdx) and [app config](configuration-app-config-getting-started.mdx) to create custom behavior and appearance. You can also learn about the [components](sdk-components-overview.mdx) and [services](sdk-services-overview.mdx) that are key to extending Geocortex Web with custom code.

## Explore the Use Cases

Explore how the app config and layout can be used to change the look and feel as well as modify and extend the built-in behavior of a Geocortex Web Application.

## Take your Application Further with the SDK

Use the [Geocortex Web SDK](sdk-overview.mdx) and [Geocortex Workflow SDK](../workflow/sdk-overview.mdx) to build completely custom UI and behavior.
