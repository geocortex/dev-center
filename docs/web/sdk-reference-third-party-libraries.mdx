## Installing packages

You can install packages directly from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) the same way you would in other JavaScript projects, and import them in your code using the [ES6 import syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import):

For example, to install and use the [classnames](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames), first install the package:

```sh
npm install classnames
```

and then import it in your code:

```tsx
// highlight-next-line
import classNames from "classnames";

export default function ExampleComponent(props) {
    return (
        <div
            className={classNames("ExampleComponent", {
                "ExampleComponent-active": props.active,
            })}
        >
            I am a React component.
        </div>
    );
}
```
