Geocortex Web was designed to be fully internationalizable on all levels of the product, from app config to custom code. A major component of this is language strings. Language strings provide a couple advantages over hardcoding plain text in a component.

1. Language strings can be easily translated or modified without having to change component code.
2. Language strings can be shared across components.
3. Language strings consolidate user facing text throughout the application, making it easy to review and find.

It is recommended you use language strings for all user facing text in your application.

## Defining Language Strings

Language strings are defined as properties in a plain JSON file. It's convention to define language strings with the format `language-kebab-cased-key`.

```json title="en.json"
{
    "language-some-text-string": "I will be translated."
}
```

:::warning
If you define a language string that Geocortex Web has already defined, it will override the existing language string with your custom string.
:::

By convention, these files are named after the locale they represent. For example, a file of german language strings would be named `de.json`.

## Registering Language Resources

All language resource files need to be registered with the SDK before they can be used.

```ts title="src/index.ts"
...
import enJson from "./en.json";

export default function (registry: LibraryRegistry) {
    ...
    registry.registerLanguageResources({
        locale: "en",
        getValues: () => enJson,
    });
    ...
}
```

Once a set of language strings has been registered, they can be used [in the app config](configuration-app-config-reference.mdx#internationalization) or in [custom components](sdk-components-internationalization.mdx).

## Supported Locales

Geocortex Web has full language tag support as specified in the [WC3 spec](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-choosing-language-tags#regionsubtag). The casing of a language tag determines what is it parsed as.

-   All lowercase tags like `de` are parsed as a language code.
-   Region codes, like `de-AT` are uppercase.
-   Script codes like `ru-Latn` are pascal cased.

:::warning
Regional locales will **not** be used as fallback locales for a language. This means that if a browser is configured in the `de` locale, but language strings are registered with the `de-AT` locale in Geocortex Web, the fallback translation, **not** `de-AT`, will be shown.
