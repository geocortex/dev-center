**Events** are distinct, discrete messaging about a change or update that occurs in the viewer. They can be published or subscribed to by any [component](sdk-components-overview.mdx) or [service](sdk-services-overview.mdx), and can be used to initiate behaviors, communicate data changes, and more. Events themselves do not execute behavior, but merely provide messaging so subscribers can act on changes.

Events are internal to Geocortex Web, so they can only be consumed by custom code. Custom components can access events through [their models](sdk-events-reference.mdx#component-models-1) or through the [UIContext](sdk-components-ui-context.mdx). Custom services can publish or subscribe to built-in or custom events [through the MessageBus](sdk-events-reference.mdx#services-1).

The full list of existing events available in Geocortex Web can be [found in the API documentation](api-commands-operations-events.mdx#events).

Events in Geocortex Web are grouped by categories, such as `ui` or `viewer`.

```
ui.activated
coordinates.coordinate-systems-changed
viewer.layout-changed
auth.sign-in-failed
```

Events can publish custom arguments with information about the change they are communicating.
