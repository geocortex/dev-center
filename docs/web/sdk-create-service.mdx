Creating a new custom [service](concepts-components-services.mdx#services) involves a few important steps:

1. [Create the service source file](#create-the-service)
1. [Register the service in your library registration file](#register-the-service)

## Create the Service

Create the service source file in a new folder within the `src/services` folder. For example to create a new service called `ExampleService`, create a new file called `ExampleService.ts` in `src/services/ExampleService` with the following content:

```ts title="src/services/ExampleService.ts"
import { ServiceBase } from "@geocortex/web/services";

export default class ExampleService extends ServiceBase {}
```

If you want your service to be able to serialize and deserialize configuration specific to the service from app.json, you can extend from `ConfigurableServiceBase` instead:

```ts title="src/services/ExampleService.ts"
import { ServiceModelProperties } from "@geocortex/web/models";
import { ConfigurableServiceBase, serializable } from "@geocortex/web/services";

interface ExampleModelProperties extends ServiceModelProperties {
    exampleProperty: string;
}

// highlight-start
@serializable
export default class ExampleService extends ConfigurableServiceBase<
    ExampleModelProperties
> {
    // highlight-end
    exampleProperty: string;
}
```

## Register the Service

Finally we need to register the service with the Geocortex Web service registry so that it is aware of your new service.

To simplify the module imports, we'll make a new file in the `ExampleService` folder called `index.ts`. Note that this file is for convenience, and is not required:

```ts title="src/services/ExampleService/index.ts"
export { default } from "./ExampleService";
```

Now register your service with the service registry by modifying the `src/index.ts` file:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { LibraryRegistry } from "@geocortex/web/config";

// highlight-next-line
import ExampleService from "./services/ExampleService";

export default function (registry: LibraryRegistry) {
    // ... other item registrations

    // highlight-start
    registry.registerService({
        id: "example",
        getServiceType: () => ExampleService,
        // Use this setting if you want your service to load on
        // application startup. Defaults to `false`.
        loadOnStartup: true,
    });
    // highlight-end
}
```
