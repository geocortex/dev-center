Geocortex Web uses dependency injection as a way to obtain a reference to Geocortex Web [services](sdk-services-overview.mdx) in your application. Services can be referenced from other services.

:::note
If a [custom command or operation](sdk-services-commands-operations.mdx#implementing-commands-and-operations) can accomplish the behavior you need without a direct service reference, this is preferred to decrease the degree of coupling.
:::

The `@inject` decorator can be used to reference a service from within your custom service. The following example demonstrates injecting the `RegionService` into a custom service.

```ts
import { ServiceBase } from "@geocortex/web/services";
import { RegionService } from "@geocortex/web/region";
import { FrameworkServiceType, inject } from "@geocortex/web/services";

export default class CustomDataService extends ServiceBase {
    // NOTE: This property isn't populated until the service is `initialized`.
    // It is not available in the constructor of this service.
    // highlight-start
    @inject(FrameworkServiceType.REGION)
    regionService: RegionService | undefined;
    // highlight-end

    private _distance = "100";

    get distance(): string {
        return this.regionService &&
            this.regionService.measurementSystem === "metric"
            ? `${this._distance} m`
            : `${this._distance} ft`;
    }
}
```

The property that the `@inject` decorator is bound to **will be populated during the [initialization process](sdk-components-reference.mdx#initialization-and-teardown)** of the service that the decorator was used in. The property value will be `undefined` until the service is initialized.
