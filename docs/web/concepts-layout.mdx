:::

A layout consists of declarative XML that defines an applications visual structure and data sources. Think of it as the blueprints on which a Geocortex Web Application is built.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<layout xmlns="https://geocortex.com/layout/v1">
    <map>
        <zoom margin="0.5"/>
    </map>
</layout>
```

The first thing it does is declare a `<map>` component that uses the default map configuration.
Next, a zoom widget is embedded within the map. This does two things:

1. Visually places the element inside the map
2. Tells the zoom widget to act upon [the map it is placed in](concepts-advanced-layout.mdx#nested-model-imports)

<FollowAlongSnippet />

The basic example shown above will place a zoom widget inside a map. But what if you want the zoom widget to be in the top right corner? At the bottom center of the map? How does the map know where to place it?

## Slotting

The position of a component within its parent is controlled by what slot it is placed into.

For example, this configuration will place the zoom widget in the top right of the map.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<layout xmlns="https://geocortex.com/layout/v1">
    <map>
        // highlight-next-line
        <zoom padding="0.5" slot="top-right"/>
    </map>
</layout>
```

If a slot configuration is not given, the component will slot itself into a default position. Each component defines its own slots - not every slot will work for every component.

Slots control how one element fits into another. But how do we control how sibling elements position themselves? The answer is stacks and splits.

## Stacks and Splits

The basic `stack` and `split` components form building blocks that layout authors can use to vertically or horizontally partition components and blocks of rich text to form simple and complex user interfaces alike.

Leveraging these simple primitives correctly also means responsive apps that work on various screen sizes.

Stacks and splits are used to partition the viewer into rectangular sectors, each filled with whichever components you desire.

The best way to think of stacks is that every item within them is being ordered top to bottom:

```xml
<stack>
    <text text="item1"/>
    <text text="item2"/>
    <text text="item3"/>
</stack>
```

<img className="stackSplitImage" src={useBaseUrl("img/stack-split-1.png")} />

The best way to think of splits is that every item within them is being ordered left to right:

```xml
<split>
    <text text="item1"/>
    <text text="item2"/>
    <text text="item3"/>
</split>
```

<img className="stackSplitImage" src={useBaseUrl("img/stack-split-2.png")} />

When creating complex layouts with embedded stacks and splits, it's good to picture building it from the inside out:

```xml
<stack>
    <split>
        <text text="item1"/>
        <stack>
            <text text="item2"/>
            <text text="item3"/>
        </stack>
    </split>
    <split>
        <text text="item4"/>
        <text text="item5"/>
        <text text="item6"/>
    </split>
</stack>
```

We start by building the first inner-most stack:

<img className="stackSplitImage" src={useBaseUrl("img/stack-split-4.png")} />

Then slot that into the split one level up:

<img className="stackSplitImage" src={useBaseUrl("img/stack-split-5.png")} />

We then build the next split:

<img className="stackSplitImage" src={useBaseUrl("img/stack-split-6.png")} />

And finally slot those two splits into the outer-most stack:

<img className="stackSplitImage" src={useBaseUrl("img/stack-split-3.png")} />

## Panels

Another core concept that Geocortex Web uses to organize elements in a layout is **panels**.
Panels are a container component that enable hierarchal navigation between different components.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<layout xmlns="https://geocortex.com/layout/v1">
    <split resizable="true">
        <panel width="26">
            <stack>
                <search/>
                <results-list/>
            </stack>
            <feature-details/>
        </panel>
        <map/>
    </split>
</layout>
```

When you first open the panel, the first component in the panel is activated. In this example, it's the `<stack>` component containing a `<search>` and `<results-list>`.
When a feature in the results list is opened, the `<feature-details>` component will be activated. At this point, the panel takes over the activation of the component. It will display the new component overtop of the existing visible component, and provide a back button to navigate to the previous component. The activation and deactivation algorithms for a panel rely on the concept of a stacking order of components laid on top of each other, with the first component being the bottommost, and the last being the topmost. In the example above, the `<stack>` containing `<search>` is the lowest, while the `<feature-details>` is the topmost.

### Activation

-   If the target component exists in the panel, then deactivate components above it until the target component is active
    -   Else, the target component must be deactivated, so activate it and place it above the existing component.

### Deactivation

-   If the component is the topmost element (it is active), then deactivate it.
    -   Else, the component is already inactive

These are just a few examples of the building blocks available to help you organize the layout of your Application. You can also use tabs, expanders, and much more. See the [Component Reference](api-components.mdx) for a full listing.

## Models

Components often observe and modify the state of other components.
Consider the following example:

```xml
<map>
    <scalebar slot="bottom-left"/>
</map>
```

The scale bar component displays information about a particular map. More specifically, it is **dependent** on the data of a map model to display its values.

Components express this data dependency in the form of models that are marked as "imported" or "exported". If we know that the scale bar "imports" a particular type of model, and that the map "exports" the same type of model, we can resolve those dependencies simply by plugging exported models into the components that import them.

```ts
@exportModel
export class MapComponent {
    // ... map stuff ...
}

export class ScaleBarComponent {
    @importModel("map-extension")
    map: MapExtension | undefined;

    // ... scale bar stuff ...
}
```

When the system places the scale bar into the layout, it will attempt to satisfy any model imports declared by the component. By default, this happens by walking up the tree from the location of the component being slotted and simply finding the first ancestor that exports a model with the matching type, like in the basic example above.

:::note
Learn more about how [models are automatically matched](concepts-advanced-layout.mdx#nested-model-imports).
:::

However, in the following example with two scale bars, how does each scale bar know which map model it corresponds to? Both are placed outside of a `<map>` component, and there are two possible map models to bind to.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<layout xmlns="https://geocortex.com/layout/v1">
    <stack>
      <split grow="1">
        <map id="map-a" grow="1" margin="3"/>
        <map id="map-b" grow="1" margin="3"/>
      </split>
      <split grow="1" valign="center" >
          <scalebar id="a" grow="1" margin="3"/>
          <scalebar id="b" grow="1" margin="3"/>
      </split>
    </stack>
</layout>
```

We can explicitly bind each scale bar to the appropriate map with the `models` attribute. The `models` attribute will tell a component to look for an exported model on the component matched by the expression. In this example, the `models` attributes are looking for components with the `id` `map-a` and `map-b` respectively.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<layout xmlns="https://geocortex.com/layout/v1">
    <split>
        <panel width="23" active="true">
            <stack>
                <split>
                    <text text="Map A Scale Bar"></text>
                    <scalebar id="a" models="#map-a"/>
                </split>
                <split>
                    <text text="Map B Scale Bar"></text>
                    <scalebar id="b" models="#map-b"/>
                </split>
            </stack>
        </panel>
        <map id="map-a"/>
        <map id="map-b"/>
    </split>
</layout>
```

## Namespaces

Every component in the xml file has a definition that lives in an xml namespace. All the components discussed to this point have lived in the `https://geocortex.com/layout/v1` namespace.

```xml
<layout xmlns="https://geocortex.com/layout/v1">
    <map/>
</layout>
```

Geocortex Web has a specific namespace `https://geocortex.com/layout/web/v1` in which components like `<bookmarks>` live. You can add this namespace to your layout to use these components.

```xml
<layout xmlns="https://geocortex.com/layout/v1"
        // highlight-next-line
        xmlns:web="https://geocortex.com/layout/web/v1">
    <map>
        <web:bookmarks slot="bottom-right" />
        <web:scale-input slot="bottom-left" />
    </map>
</layout>
```

When adding custom components, you will need to [add their custom namespace](usecases-implement-component-with-ui.mdx#add-the-component-to-your-layout) to your xml definition.

## Next Steps: Components and App Config

In our examples so far, xml elements like `<text>` or `<stack>` have been used. Each of these xml elements corresponds to a Component in Geocortex Web. Each component has its own configuration, such as the `text` property for `<text>` elements. Most components have required configuration, and this configuration is defined in an App, specifically, in the `app.json` file. This allows a separation of the visual structure of how components appear in the viewer, and the functional content these components host. Combining layouts with app configuration allows you to create powerful, flexible applications with responsive, declarative layouts.
