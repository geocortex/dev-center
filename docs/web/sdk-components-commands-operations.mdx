When writing custom components you may want to take advantage of Geocortex Web's large [built-in suite of command and operations](api-commands-operations-events.mdx) or your own custom commands and operations.

## Running Commands and Operations

Components can run commands and operations in two ways; through the component model, or through the React component.

:::tip
It is best practice to run commands and operations through the components model, and express the result through a change in the models data rendered by the component.
:::

### Command and Operations in a Model

Commands and operations can be run through the `messages` property of the model.

```ts
@serializable
export default class ExampleComponentModel extends ComponentModelBase {
    async displayConfirmDialog(){
        const didConfirm = await this.messages.operations.ui.confirm.execute({
            title: "Confirm me"
        })
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

### Command and Operations in a Component

Commands and operations can be run through the [`UIContext` of a component](sdk-ui-context.mdx).

```ts
export default function CustomComponent(props) {
    // highlight-next-line
    const { operations, commands } = useContext(UIContext);

    const displayConfirmDialog = async () => {
        const result = await operations.ui.confirm.execute({
            title: "Confirm Me",
        });
        ...
    };
    ...
}
```

## Implementing Commands and Operations

Components can also register an implementation for any command or operation. This allows the creation of commands which can affect the UI. When registering a command implementation for a component, you have to register the implementation in the [component's model](sdk-component-reference.mdx#models). The command must also be registered in the library entry point. The following component model registers an implementation for a custom command that takes a custom argument type.

:::note
It's best practice to expose the arguments and return values for commands and operations as public interfaces, as this allows consumers of the command or operation to have the appropriate typing.
:::

<Tabs
  defaultValue="model"
  values={[
    { label: "Component Model", value: "model" },
    { label: "Registration", value: "registration" },
  ]}>
<TabItem value="model">

```tsx
export interface CustomCommandArg {
    someProp: string;
}

@serializable
export default class CustomModel extends ComponentModelBase {
    private _handles: IHandle[] = [];

    protected async _onInitialize(): Promise<void> {
        await super._onInitialize();

        this._handles.push(
            this.messages
                .command<CustomCommandArg>("custom.my-command")
                .register((arg: CustomCommandArg) => {
                    console.log(
                        `Executing 'custom.my-command' with argument '${arg.someProp}'`
                    );
                    return;
                })
        );
    }

    destroy(): void {
        super.destroy();

        // Clean up event handlers.
        this._handles.forEach((h) => h.remove());
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="registration">

```ts
export default function (registry: LibraryRegistry) {
    ...

    registry.registerCommand("custom.my-command")
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### `canExecute` Hook

## Running Custom Commands

You can run the custom commands or operations you define from another component, model, or service by locating them by ID and providing the appropriate type arguments.

```ts
@serializable
export default class ExampleComponentModel extends ComponentModelBase {
    async runCustomCommandsAndOperations() {
        // highlight-start
        await command<CustomCommandArg>("custom.my-command").execute({
            someProp: "some arg",
        });
        // highlight-end

        // highlight-start
        const result = await operation<InputArgType, OutputArgType>(
            "custom.my-operation"
        ).execute({
            some: "arg",
        });
        // highlight-end
        // ...
    }
    // ...
}
```
