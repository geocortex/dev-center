Both the `@command` and `@operation` decorator functions can take an optional second argument specifying parameters that affect the behavior of the command or operation.

The `targetInactive` option applies to commands and operations implemented through a component model. The default value is false. If `targetInactive` is set to true, the command or operation will be executed even if the associated component is not currently active in the layout

```ts
// highlight-next-line
@command("custom.my-command", { targetInactive: true })
protected _myCommand() {
    console.log(
        `Executing 'custom.my-command even if the associated
        component does not exist in the layout.`
    );
    return;
}
```

The `parallel` option applies to commands only. The default value is false. By default, if a command has multiple implementations, each implementation is executed sequentially in the order it was registered in the library, and multiple component model implementations are executed in layout order. Setting `parallel` to true causes the command implementation to be run in parallel with other implementations marked as `parallel`.

:::note
If there is a mix of parallel and sequential command implementations, then the parallel implementations will run concurrently after all sequential implementations have finished executing.

```ts
// highlight-next-line
@command("custom.my-command", { parallel: true })
protected _myCommand() {
    console.log(
        `This implementation will be executed in parallel
        with other command implementations marked as parallel.`
    );
    return;
}
```
