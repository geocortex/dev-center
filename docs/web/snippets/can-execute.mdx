Commands can optionally register a hook function which indicates whether it is possible to execute the command. This is accomplished by implementing a "canExecute" method in the same class as the command implementation. This method is decorated with `@canExecute` and returns a boolean indicating whether the command can or cannot run based on the given argument.

```tsx
@command("custom.divide-ten-by-x")
protected _divideTenByX(x: number): void {
    this.messages.commands.ui.alert.execute({
        message: `10 / ${x} is ${10 / x}`,
    });
}

// highlight-start
@canExecute("custom.divide-ten-by-x")
protected _canExecuteDivideTenByX(x: number): boolean {
    return x !== 0;
}
// highlight-end
```

If the `canExecute` hook for the command implementation returns true, the `execute` hook will be called. If the function returns false, the `execute` hook will not be called. Some components, like the I Want To Menu, use the `canExecute` hook to disable buttons when no implementations of a command can be executed. This is accomplished through the `canExecuteChanged` event. This event can be published or subscribed to in order to react to changing command execution conditions.

```tsx
this.messages
    .command("custom.command-with-can-execute")
    .canExecuteChanged.publish();

this.messages
    .command("custom.command-with-can-execute")
    .canExecuteChanged.subscribe(() => {
        // .. react to can execute status changing
    });
```
