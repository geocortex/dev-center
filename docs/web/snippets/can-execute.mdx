Commands can optionally register a hook function which indicates whether it is possible to execute the command. This `canExecute` callback is passed as the second argument to the `register` function.

```tsx
this.messages.command<number>("custom.my-command").register(
    (arg: number) => {
        // ...
        return;
    },
    // highlight-start
    (arg: number) => {
        return arg < 5;
    }
);
// highlight-end
```

If the `canExecute` hook returns true, the command will be executed. If the function returns false, the command will not be executed.
Some components, like the I Want To Menu, use the `canExecute` hook to disable buttons when appropriate. This is accomplished through the `canExecuteChanged` event. This event can be published or subscribed to in order to react to changing command execution conditions.

```tsx
this.messages
    .command("custom.command-with-can-execute")
    .canExecuteChanged.publish();

this.messages
    .command("custom.command-with-can-execute")
    .canExecuteChanged.subscribe(() => {
        // .. react to can execute status changing
    });
```
