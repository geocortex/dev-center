## Stacks and Splits

Stacks and splits are used to partition the viewer into rectangular sectors, each filled with whichever components you desire.

The best way to think of stacks is that every item within them is being ordered top to bottom:

```xml
<stack>
    <text text="item1"/>
    <text text="item2"/>
    <text text="item3"/>
</stack>
```

<img className="stackSplitImage" src={useBaseUrl("img/stack-split-1.png")} />

The best way to think of splits is that every item within them is being ordered left to right:

```xml
<split>
    <text text="item1"/>
    <text text="item2"/>
    <text text="item3"/>
</split>
```

<img className="stackSplitImage" src={useBaseUrl("img/stack-split-2.png")} />

When creating complex layouts with embedded stacks and splits, it's good to picture building it from the inside out:

```xml
<stack>
    <split>
        <text text="item1"/>
        <stack>
            <text text="item2"/>
            <text text="item3"/>
        </stack>
    </split>
    <split>
        <text text="item4"/>
        <text text="item5"/>
        <text text="item6"/>
    </split>
</stack>
```

We start by building the first inner-most stack:

<img className="stackSplitImage" src={useBaseUrl("img/stack-split-4.png")} />

Then slot that into the split one level up:

<img className="stackSplitImage" src={useBaseUrl("img/stack-split-5.png")} />

We then build the next split:

<img className="stackSplitImage" src={useBaseUrl("img/stack-split-6.png")} />

And finally slot those two splits into the outer-most stack:

<img className="stackSplitImage" src={useBaseUrl("img/stack-split-3.png")} />

## Panels

Panels are a container component that enable hierarchal navigation between different components.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<layout xmlns="https://geocortex.com/layout/v1">
    <split resizable="true">
        <panel width="26">
            <stack>
                <search/>
                <results-list/>
            </stack>
            <feature-details/>
        </panel>
        <map/>
    </split>
</layout>
```

For a deeper dive into Panels, [check out the api reference](api-layout-core-components.mdx#panels).

When you first open the panel, the first component in the panel is activated. In this example, it's the `<stack>` component containing a `<search>` and `<results-list>`.
When a feature in the results list is opened, the `<feature-details>` component will be activated. At this point, the panel takes over the activation of the component. It will display the new component overtop of the existing visible component, and provide a back button to navigate to the previous component. The activation and deactivation algorithms for a panel rely on the concept of a stacking order of components laid on top of each other, with the first component being the bottommost, and the last being the topmost. In the example above, the `<stack>` containing `<search>` is the lowest, while the `<feature-details>` is the topmost.

### Activation

-   If the target component exists in the panel, then deactivate components above it until the target component is active
    -   Else, the target component must be deactivated, so activate it and place it above the existing component.

### Deactivation

-   If the component is the topmost element (it is active), then deactivate it.
    -   Else, the component is already inactive
