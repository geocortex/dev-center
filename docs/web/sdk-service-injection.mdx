description: Geocortex Web - Injecting services into component models and other services.
---

Geocortex Web uses dependency injection as a way to obtain a reference to Geocortex Web [services](concepts-components-services.mdx#services) in your application. Services can be referenced from within a [component model](concepts-components-services.mdx#component-models-and-configuration) or another service.

The easiest way to obtain a reference to a service is by using the `@inject` decorator from within your component model or service. For example to inject the `RegionService` from within a component model:

```ts title="ExampleComponentModel.ts"
import { ComponentModelBase } from "@geocortex/web/models";
import { RegionService } from "@geocortex/web/region";
// highlight-next-line
import { FrameworkServiceType, inject } from "@geocortex/web/services";

export default class ExampleComponentModel extends ComponentModelBase {
    // NOTE: This property isn't populated until the model is `initialized`.
    // It is not available in the constructor of this model.
    // highlight-next-line
    @inject(FrameworkServiceType.REGION)
    // highlight-next-line
    regionService: RegionService | undefined;

    private _distance = "100";

    get distance(): string {
        return this.regionService?.measurementSystem === "metric"
            ? `${this._distance} m`
            : `${this._distance} ft`;
    }
}
```

Note that the `@inject` decorator will automatically inject a reference to the service only when used from within a component model or service. The property that the `@inject` decorator is bound to **will be populated during the initialization process of the given component model or service** that the decorator was used in. The property value will be `undefined` until the component model or service is initialized.
