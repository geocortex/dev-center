Services act as a repository of accessible behavior and data, and can be used for a variety of purposes, from implementing commands and operations, to managing shared data, to interfacing with the REST API of an external service.

## Service Registration

All services need to be registered with Geocortex Web. Services can optionally use the `itemType` property to bind to an [item in the app config](configuration-app-config-reference.mdx#app-items).

```ts
export default function(registry: LibraryRegistry) {
    ...
    registry.registerService({
        id: "custom-service",
        getServiceType: () => CustomService,
        // Use this setting if you want your service to load an
        // item from the app config.
        itemType: "custom-service-model",
        // Use this setting if you want your service to load on
        // application startup. Defaults to `false`.
        loadOnStartup: true,
    })
    ...
}
```

## Service Lifecycle

On application load, all services that are configured to automatically load on startup are created and initialized **in parallel**, along with core services like the message bus.

All other services are created and initialized (i.e. the `_onInitialize` method is called) when they are first invoked. This can happen in multiple ways.

-   If a command or operation implemented by the service is executed, then the service will be created and initialized to run that command.
-   If a different component or service injects the service, then the service will be created and initialized to fulfill that dependency.

Services are destroyed (i.e. the `destroy` method is invoked) when the application is destroyed.

## Service Anatomy

All services have access to initialization and cleanup methods, as well as the `messages` property that allows for the registration and execution of commands and operations.

### Initialization and Cleanup

Sometimes, a service is required to perform initialization and cleanup actions, for example, to initialize dynamic data and cleanup dangling references. The `ServiceBase` class has two methods to achieve this:

-   `_onInitialize()`, which can be overridden,
-   and `destroy()`, which can be implemented to facilitate cleanup.

The following service uses these methods to subscribe to an event and cleanup the event handler afterwards.

:::important
Always call `super._onInitialize()` before any custom initialization logic.
:::

```ts
import { ServiceBase } from "@geocortex/web/services";
import { MapEvent } from "@geocortex/viewer-framework/messaging/registry/map";

export default class CustomService extends ServiceBase {
    handles: IHandle[] = [];

    protected async _onInitialize(): Promise<void> {
        await super._onInitialize();
        this.handles.push(
            this.messages.events.map.initialized.subscribe((e: MapEvent) => {
                console.log(
                    "Map Initialized, do your map dependent model setup here."
                );
            })
        );
        return;
    }

    destroy(): void {
        this.handles.forEach((h) => h.remove());
    }
}
```

### Message Bus

All services have access to the `messages` property on the class instance, which gives access to all [commands, operations, and events in the application](sdk-services-commands-operations.mdx#running-commands-and-operations).

## Models and Configuration

Like components, services can be configured through the [app config](configuration-app-config-getting-started.mdx). A service can participate in the config by extending the `ConfigurableServiceBase` class. For more information on the relationship between services and configuration, check out [this article](sdk-serializable-properties.mdx). The following example demonstrates a service with one configurable property, `name`.

:::note
The service is linked to the config through the `itemType` and `id` properties.
