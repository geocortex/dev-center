description: Geocortex Web - Accessing the UIContext in Components

[Custom components](usecases-implement-component-with-ui.mdx) often need to access the application context to run [commands and operations](concepts-commands-operations.mdx), subscribe and publish to [events](concepts-events.mdx), and more. A component has two ways of accessing the application context.

First, every component has a [model](usecases-implement-component-participate-app-config.mdx#component-models) which in turn has a [`MessageBus`](api-message-bus.mdx) that can be used to access commands, operations, and events. All application context interactions can be facilitated by the model.

<!-- TODO: Link to i18n docs for web -->

Optionally, a component can use the `UIContext` to access commands, operations and events, as well as use the `translate` function to take advantage of our internationalization features.

## Accessing the UIContext

The `UIContext` is injected into a component with the [React `useContext` hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecontext).

```tsx
import { UIContext } from "@geocortex/web/ui";
import { useContext } from "react";

export default function CustomComponent(props) {
    const { command, event, operation, translate, hostElement } = useContext(
        UIContext
    );
    // ...
}
```

Once you have reference to the `UIContext`, you can access its properties and interact with the application context in your custom component.

### hostElement

The UIContext provides access to the DOM through the `hostElement` property. However, this is meant to be a last resort, intended for enabling complex third party libraries. The DOM should only be interacted with through the abstraction of React components whenever possible.
