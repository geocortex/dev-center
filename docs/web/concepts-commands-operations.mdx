:::note Before learning about commands and operations...
Check out the [Key Concepts](concepts-key-concepts.mdx).
:::

**Commands and operations** are runnable, independent units of work within Geocortex Web. Using the Geocortex Web SDK, it's possible to [define custom commands and operations](usecases-implement-command-operation.mdx) for use throughout the application. Commands are units of work which may take an input but do not produce an output, and operations differ because they produce output.

The full list of existing commands and operations available in Geocortex Web can be [found in the API documentation](api-commands-operations-events.mdx).

Commands and Operations are grouped by namespace, for example:

```
auth.sign-in
auth.sign-out
edit.add-feature
edit.delete-features
```

Commands and operations are used to power much of Geocortex Web's built in behavior and interactions. They can be run through [configuration](usecases-run-command-with-button.mdx), or through [custom services](sdk-services-commands-operations.mdx) or [components](sdk-components-commands-operations). They power everything from basic components like the IWTM, to advanced functionality like the results list.

By using commands and operations, you can deeply customize Geocortex Web's behavior with only configuration.

```json
{
    "items": [
        ...
        {
            "id": "iwtm-config-1",
            "items": [
                {
                    "id": "return-to-initial-view",
                    "iconId": "zoom-initial",
                    "title": "Return to Initial View",
                    // highlight-next-line
                    "action": "map.zoom-to-initial-viewpoint",
                    "$type": "menu-item"
                },
            ],
            "$type": "menu"
        },
        {
            "id": "results-list-config",
            "featureActions":     {
                "id": "results-context",
                "items": [
                    {
                        "id": "zoom",
                        "iconId": "zoom-feature",
                        "title": "Zoom to Feature",
                        // highlight-next-line
                        "action": "map.zoom-to-features",
                        "$type": "menu-item"
                    },
                    {
                        "id": "remove-feature",
                        "iconId": "trash",
                        "title": "Remove Feature",
                        // highlight-next-line
                        "action": "results.remove",
                        "$type": "menu-item"
                    },
                ],
                "$type": "menu"
            },
            "onFeatureClick": [
                // highlight-next-line
                "results.display-details"
            ],
            "$type": "results"
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

## Workflow

Geocortex Workflow can allow for the creation of completely customized behavior without writing custom code. Geocortex Web has a special command, `workflow.run`, which allows you to run workflows anywhere you would run a command or operation. Using workflow, you can take custom behavior in Geocortex Web further without having to write custom code.

## Next Steps

Geocortex Web has a large array of built-in command and operations that you can chain to power custom behavior. Custom commands and operations can also be implemented with the SDK.
