:::note Before learning about commands and operations...
Check out the [Key Concepts](concepts-key-concepts.mdx).
:::

**Commands and operations** are runnable, independent units of work within Geocortex Web. Using the Geocortex Web SDK, it's possible to [define custom commands and operations](usecases-implement-command-operation.mdx) for use throughout the application. Commands are units of work which may take an input but do not produce an output, and operations differ because they produce output. Commands and Operations are grouped by namespace, for example:

```
auth.sign-in
auth.sign-out
edit.add-feature
edit.delete-features
```

[Components or Services](concepts-components-services.mdx) are usually responsible for registering a command or operation implementation with Geocortex Web. Once a command or operation has been registered, it can be used from anywhere in the application. [Custom Commands and Operations](usecases-implement-command-operation.mdx) are registered with custom services or custom components in this manner.

## Passing Arguments

Commands and Operations are most commonly used to configure the behavior of components. For example, here's configuration for the `featureActions` and `onFeatureClick` behaviors of a `<results-list>` component.

```json
{
    "schemaVersion": "1.0",
    "items": [
        ...
        {
            "id": "results-list",
            "$type": "results",
            "featureActions": [
                "item://menu-item/zoom",
                "item://menu-item/save-features-to-csv"
            ],
            // highlight-next-line
            "onFeatureClick": "results.display-details"
        },
        {
            "id": "zoom",
            "$type": "menu-item",
            "title": "Zoom to Features",
            // highlight-next-line
            "action": ["map.zoom-to-features", "highlights.pulse"]
        },
        {
            "id": "save-features-to-csv",
            "$type": "menu-item",
            "title": "Save Features to CSV",
            // highlight-next-line
            "action": ["results.convert-to-csv", "system.download-file"]
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

App config properties that accept a command or operation can take a single operation (such as with the `onFeatureClick` on the `results-list`) or they can take a **command chain** (such as with the `action` property on `save-features-to-csv`).

:::note
Command chains are arrays of commands and operations which are executed sequentially. The output of previous operations is passed along the chain to future operations and commands, allowing for complex input dependent behavior.
:::

Since these commands and operations are running from the [context](https://docs.geocortex.com/webviewer/latest/admin-help/Default.htm#gwv/add-a-workflow-to-an-app.htm#use-the-menu-context-as-a-workflow-input) of a `<results-list>` component, the first command or operation will receive the relevant feature as its input. If the property is a command chain, the next step in line will receive one of two possible inputs.

1. If the previous step was a command (which doesn't produce output), then the original input is passed on to the next step.
2. If the previous step was an operation (which produces an output), then the output of that operation is passed onto the next step.

In this way, you can run multiple commands in a row that receive a feature as input, as seen in the `action` command chain of `zoom-feature` in the example.

```json
["map.zoom-to-features", "highlights.pulse"]
```

The `action` command chain of `save-features-to-csv` demonstrates how an operation can pass its output to the next command or operation in the list. In this case, it's passing the csv content to `system.download-file`.

```json
["results.convert-to-csv", "system.download-file"]
```

## Passing Named Arguments

If you choose, you can override the default arguments passed into a command or operation by providing an `arguments` property.

```json
{
    "$type": "menu",
    "id": "iwtm",
    "items": [
        {
            "title": "Hello",
            "isEnabled": true,
            "iconId": "info",
            "action": {
                "name": "ui.display-notification",
                "arguments": {
                    "message": "World"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

<!-- TODO-API link to displayNotification args -->

This will override the default argument passing behavior for that command or operation. For example, `ui.display-notification` takes a object of type `DisplayNotificationArgs`, which has the property `message` of type `string`.

## Example: Configured Map and I Want to Menu

<Tabs
  defaultValue="app"
  values={[
    { label: 'App Config', value: 'app', },
    { label: 'Layout', value: 'layout', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="app">

```json title="app.json"
{
    "schemaVersion": "1.0",
    "items": [
        {
            "$type": "map-extension",
            "id": "default",
            "webMap": "https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=0ba877a4185448cb832af9a661031e31",
            "onClick": [
                "tasks.identify",
                "highlights.add-focus",
                "results.display"
            ]
        },
        {
            "$type": "menu",
            "id": "iwtm",
            "items": [
                {
                    "title": "Return to Default Map View",
                    "isEnabled": true,
                    "action": [
                        {
                            "name": "map.zoom-to-initial-viewpoint",
                            "arguments": ["item://map-extension/default"]
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="layout">

```xml title="layout.xml"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<layout xmlns="https://geocortex.com/layout/v1">
    <split resizable="true">
        <panel show-close-button="false" width="26">
            <results-list active="true"/>
            <feature-details active="false"/>
        </panel>
        <map config="default">
            <iwtm config="iwtm" slot="top-left"/>
        </map>
    </split>
</layout>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This example demonstrates two different types of argument passing behavior. The first action in the app config is a command chain defined on the `onClick` property of a map. This chain consists of three operations and commands:

-   `task.identify`,
-   `highlights.add-focus`
-   `results.display`

`tasks.identify` does not have any named arguments defined, so it will take arguments passed into it from its current [context](https://docs.geocortex.com/webviewer/latest/admin-help/Default.htm#gwv/add-a-workflow-to-an-app.htm#use-the-menu-context-as-a-workflow-input). Since this chain is run on a map click, the context argument passed in has the shape:

```json
{
  "geometry": "Esri.Point(<map-click-location>)",
  ... <other props>
}
```

<!-- TODO-API tasks.identify operation direct link -->

`tasks.identify` receives this argument, and since it is an operation, produces an output. Looking at the [Commands and Operations Documentation](api-commands-operations.mdx), `tasks.identify` has output of type `Features`.

`highlights.add-focus` and `results.display` both take a `Features` type input, so the output of `tasks.identify` will work nicely. `highlights.add-focus` is immediately after `tasks.identify`, so it receives the output of identify. Since `highlights.add-focus` is a command, it does not produce any output. `results.display` will receive the output of the last operation, `tasks.identify`. In this way, you can pass the output of an operation to multiple commands.

<!-- TODO-API MapExtensionArgs direct link -->

The second command/operation in this application is a `map.zoom-to-initial-viewpoint` command on the I Want To Menu. This command takes `Maps` type argument. The `argument` property in the app config supplies an array of maps by referencing the `default` map with an [**Item Uri**](concepts-advanced-config.mdx#item-uris). Item URIs are a way of referencing other items within the app config.

## Next Steps

Geocortex Web has a large array of built-in command and operations that you can chain to power custom behavior. Custom commands and operations can also be implemented with the SDK.
