When writing custom services you may want to take advantage of Geocortex Web's large [built-in suite of command and operations](api-commands-operations-events.mdx) or your own custom commands and operations.

## Running Commands and Operations

Services can run commands and operations through the `messages` property.

```ts
export default class ExampleService extends ServiceBase {
    protected async someMethod(): Promise<void> {
        // highlight-next-line
        const { commands, command, operations, operation } = this.messages;

        // Execute a named, built-in, command.
        commands.ui.setTheme.execute("dark");

        // Execute a custom command by it's string ID. If you are executing
        // a custom command with arguments, you must provide the correct generic typings.
        command<string>("my-custom.command-that-takes-a-string").execute(
            "some arg"
        );

        // Execute a named, built-in, operation.
        const opResult = await operations.ui.confirm.execute({
            message: "hey",
        });

        // Execute a custom operation by it's string ID.
        // You must provide the correct generic typings <input, output>.
        const customOpResult = await operation<string, boolean>(
            "my-custom.operation-that-returns-a-bool"
        ).execute("some arg");

        return;
    }
}
```

## Implementing Commands and Operations

Services can also register an implementation for a command or operation. A command or operation is registered using the ID of the service and the name of the method on the service that will be called. The following service registers an implementation for an operation that returns a custom type.

:::note
It's best practice to expose the arguments and return values for commands and operations as public interfaces, as this allows consumers of the command or operation to have the appropriate typing.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="service"
  values={[
    { label: "Service", value: "service" },
    { label: "Registration", value: "registration" }
  ]}>
<TabItem value="registration">

```ts
export default function (registry: LibraryRegistry) {
    ...

    registry.registerService({
        id: "custom-service",
        getServiceType: () => CustomService
    });

    registry.registerOperation("custom.my-operation", {
        serviceId: "custom-service",
        // highlight-next-line
        executeMethodName: "_executeMyOperation",
    });
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="service">

```ts
export interface CustomCommandArg {
    someProp: string;
}

export default class ExampleService extends ServiceBase {
    // highlight-next-line
    protected _executeMyOperation(): Promise<CustomCommandArg> {
        // ... do work here
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### `canExecute` Hook

## Running Custom Commands

You can run the custom commands or operations you define from another component, model, or service by locating them by ID and providing the appropriate type arguments.

```ts
export default class ExampleService extends ServiceBase {
    async runCustomCommandsAndOperations(){
         // highlight-start
        await this.messages.command<CustomCommandArg>("custom.my-command").execute({ someProp: "some arg" );
        // highlight-end

        // highlight-start
        const result = await this.messages.operation<InputArgType, OutputArgType>("custom.my-operation").execute({
            some: "arg",
        });
        // highlight-end
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```
