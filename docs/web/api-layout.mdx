description: Geocortex Mobile - Layout XML reference
---

This is a reference for the attributes available to all components in an [app layout](concepts-layout.mdx). Some of these attributes are accessible through the [Geocortex Web Designer](https://apps.geocortex.com/webviewer/designer/), and the rest be configured through layout.

All attributes are specified as string values, and parsed into their respective types by Geocortex Web

```xml
<!-- string attribute -->
<stack id="some-id"/>
<!-- number attribute -->
<stack margin="3"/>
<!-- boolean attribute -->
<stack active="false"/>
```

## Basic Attributes

### `id`

**Type**: `string`  
**Description**: Used to uniquely identify the component in the layout.

### `config`

**Type**: `string`  
**Description**: Used to bind a component to an item in the app config. See [linking layout app config](concepts-app-config.mdx#linking-layout-to-app-config) for more details.

### `active`

**Type**: `boolean`  
**Description**: Used to mark a component as initially active and visible. \

### `models`

**Type**: `string`  
**Description**: A css selector string specifying the component with the model that needs to be resolved. See [models](concepts-layout.mdx#models) for details.

## Presentation Attributes

Components support a number of presentation attributes to adjust their positioning and styling in the application after slotting. Some of these presentation attributes are accessible through the [Geocortex Web Designer](https://apps.geocortex.com/webviewer/designer/), and the rest be configured through layout.

:::note
All dimensional units are expressed in 'em's, where 1 em is equal to the current font size.
:::

### `margin`

**Type**: `number`  
**Description**: Sets the size of the white space outside of the component.  
**Example**:

```xml
<map margin="1.5"/> <!-- Sets the margin on a map to be equal to 1.5em. This would be 22.5 pts high if the current font size is 15 -->
```

### `padding`

**Type**: `number`  
**Description**: Sets the size of the white space between a component and its content.  
**Applies to**: This attribute will only apply to components with children, due to technical restrictions.  
**Example**:

```xml
<stack padding="0.5"/> <!-- Sets the padding on a stack to be equal to 0.5em. This would be 7.5 pts high if the current font size is 15 -->
```

### `width`

**Type**: `number`  
**Default value**: If a width is not set, then the width shall be the natural width of the component (however much space it needs).  
**Description**: Sets the width of a component.

### `height`

**Type**: `number`  
**Description**: Sets the height of a component.  
**Example**:

```xml
<!-- Sets the width of a map to 30em, and the height to 20em. -->
<map width="30" height="20"/>
```

### `grow`

**Type**: `number`  
**Description**: Sets whether or not a component's width or height will grow over its parents primary axis. Components with a grow of 0 will fill to their natural or requested height. Components with a specified grow will fill up a percentage of the remaining space equal to their grow value divided by the total grow of all sibling components (including the component in question).  
The default value for a component varies by component. For most components, if no grow value is specified, they will default to a grow value of "0". The following components however will have a default grow value of "1":

-   Map
-   Stack
-   Split

**Applies to**: All components may specify this value, but it will only take effect if the component is a child of a split or a stack. For stacks, grow indicates how the child grows along the vertical axis. For splits, grow indicates how the child grows along the horizontal axis.  
**Example**:

```xml
<stack>
    <!-- Heading will take up whatever vertical space it requires, and will occupy its natural width. -->
    <text content="Heading"/>
    <!-- The first map will occupy 1/3 of the remaining vertical space, and will occupy the full width available. -->
    <map grow="1"/>
    <!-- The first map will occupy 2/3 of the remaining vertical space, and will occupy the full width available. -->
    <map grow="2"/>
</stack>
```

### `halign` (Horizontal Align)

**Type**: `"start" | "center" | "end"`  
**Description**: Describes how the content of a component is aligned **horizontally**. For stacks and splits, the content is the child components. For a component like text, the content is the text itself.

### `valign` (Vertical Align)

**Type**: `"start" | "center" | "end"`  
**Description**: Describes how the content of a component is aligned **vertically**. For stacks and splits, the content is the child components. For a component like text, the content is the text itself.

### Alignments Effect on cross-axis stretching

All components will stretch across the cross-axis if the corresponding alignment attribute (`halign` for stacks, `valign` for splits) is not set on the parent of that component. But if a cross-axis alignment is set, then they will no longer stretch across the cross axis (otherwise the effect of alignment would not be observed).  
Some components will stretch across the cross-axis even if the cross-axis alignment is set on the parent: map, stack, split.
